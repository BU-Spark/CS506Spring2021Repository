Replicating FCC map

How many providers have beat the threshold, 100/100 threshold

How many providers available in each municipalities 

Comcast said: nervous about MLAb because MLAB tests run on full network, not just comcast: in the house, vs comcast, vs other networks. They don't think it's their fault. Ookla on the other hand is specifically just house and comcast, so maybe that's better. Also especially at certain times. Within that tho - what correlations are there in terms of income and price. Really want to match mean speed relative to average income per municipality.

Scatter plot of income/muni, possibly a map.

ACS tables for average income in census. There's also household income, personal income, there's also income by service subscription - do you have an internet subscription, and then what is your income.
