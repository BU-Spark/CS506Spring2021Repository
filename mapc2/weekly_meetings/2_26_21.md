# Meeting on 2-26-21
## AWS 
- Decided to set up an AWS root account using the team email
- Create IAM users for personal use (Authorized people who can access it)
-- Could depend on price, need to check this
- Once we all have the IAM accounts we can move on

### AWS from the command line
- Get the AWS CLI integration tools, good docs for how to do that 

### AWS with python
- Will give us the ability to pull Ookla data via python scripts

## Google Big Query
- Will need to do roughly the same thing for big query

## After this is set, goals for deliv. 1
- get all the Ookla data for 2020 into a csv
- Figure out how to do the downsampling (svd maybe), we are kinda at the point in class where we need learn how to do this
- get one of the other towns in MA and into a csv, on google big query with the mLab data to create a debug/test set.

## Other meeting notes:
- created a channel in slack for important passwords and usernames.
- having the small data set would allow us to test things quicker
