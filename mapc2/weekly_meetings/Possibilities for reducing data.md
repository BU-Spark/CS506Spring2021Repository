Possibilities for reducing data:

- Limit to 30 minutes each day (morning, afternoon, night)
- Limit to specific days
- Average by census centroid

Better to do simplifications in the queries, rather than trying to get the data.

When to sample - if interested in school times for example, then times for that. (say 3 times between 8am and 3pm)

Talk to MAPC about possibly reproducing statistical curves after the fact. Maybe try to get avg, count, variation, min, max.

Household size may be important
