# Deliverable 3: Introduction

This document summarizes the work done for Deliverable 3, for the BU Spark! project, Spring 2021, MAPC Broadband Digital Equity in MA. This document is split into two parts:

1. This section, which acts as an overview to this deliverable
2. The section titled "Deliverable 3: Final Report Draft," which assumes the role of an initial draft for our final report in this project.

## Purpose

In this deliverable, we present our continuing work with the MLAB and Ookla datasets. Notably, we also introduce a new dataset -- 2014-2018 census income data -- and correlate broadbands speeds against this data. As with previous deliverables, there are two primary outcomes of this deliverable.

The first outcome is a continuing analysis of the datasets, with a particular focus on the following:

- Broadband speed measurement density in the Ookla dataset
- Understanding download and upload speeds per municipality in the Ookla dataset
- Correlating MLAB broadband speed against median household income, per municipality 
- Correlating Ookla download speed against median household income, per municipality.

The second outcome of this deliverable is an initial draft of our final report for this project. As such, the remaining sections will flow slightly differently than in previous deliverables; the following are a draft of our initial report. Note that we have included work from both previous deliverables and this deliverable in the upcoming sections. Each section is demarcated with the deliverable the associated work was completed in, so our progress towards this deliverable should be clear.
