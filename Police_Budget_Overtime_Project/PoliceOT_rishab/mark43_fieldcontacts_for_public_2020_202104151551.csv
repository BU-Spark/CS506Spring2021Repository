Officers were aware that the same suspect broke into cars on South Monroe Terrace, Park Street, and other streets in the area.

Officers were patrolling around Manor Street and Rosselerin Street when they turned onto Daly Street from Rosselerin Street.

Officers stopped and asked the suspect what he was doing. The suspect stated that he was minding his own business. Officers observed the suspect to be very nervous and startled at the sight of police. The suspect stated that he lived at the house at the corner of Daly Street and Spaulding Street. 

In an attempt to build further reasonable suspicion to identify the suspect, Officers drove down Daly Street with the suspect in sight via the rear view mirror. Officers turned left onto Rosemont Street, pulled up about 10 feet and backed up immediately back onto Daly Street in an attempt to observe the suspect's movements when he believed that police were gone.

 The Witness referenced previous information he gave to me and described Lenox gang AssociatesXXX, XXX, XXX, and an unknown Subject whom has been observed with them regularly.

The Witness does not know any of these Subjects by name but has provided descriptions corroborrated by our personal observations of these Subjects.



 For the purpose of simplicity I will be naming these Subjects for the remainder of this narrative with the exception of one Subject whose identity is as of yet unknown to us.

The unknown Subject has been known by us to operate a black Honda with MA REG XXXas well as a green Ford Fusion with MA REG XXXwhich we attempted to tow on March 10 2020 from one of our parking lots (Trotter Court) before he came running to retrieve it.

 According to the Witness the unknown Subject was observed driving a black sedan with XXXon Sunday June 21 2020 between the hours of 1300 and 1630 (early afternoon).



 This vehicle has also been previously associated with Lenox Associate XXX. XXXis not the Subject described by the Witness.



The Witness described the unknown Subject as wearing an orange hat which matches our observations of the unknown Subject on the same day ( orange hat, black tank top = our observations).



 At the beginning of our conversation today, the Witness stated that on Sunday June 21 2020 between the hours of 1300 and 1630 hours he overheardXXX whom was standing in front of the Lenox Apartments on Shawmut Ave advising the other Associates that if they get about fifteen people together they can surround and ""over power"" us (referring to Lenox Officers) and take back control of the area because there are only two of us.



 The Witness then continued with a description of additional activity involving the other referenced Subjects as follows:



 On Sunday the unknown Subject parked the above referenced black sedan with XXXalong Shawmut Ave adjacent to Ramsey Park near Pizza Italia.



 Shortly after the Subject's arrival XXX approached the vehicle.



 The unknown Subject stepped out of the vehicle and handed XXXa black ""banana bag"" which XXXplaced around his upper torso area.



 The unknown Subject then essentially encouraged XXXto go confront a group of people seen in the park whom were ""on their turf"". XXXthen proceeded into Ramsey Park.



 When XXXreturned from Ramsey Park, he approached XXX whom had been standing next to or sitting in a white Ford (MD REG XXXin front of XXXShawmut Ave. XXXthen advised XXXnot to go over there by himself again.

XXXthen pointed towards the ""banana bag"" around his upper torso and stated something to the effect of ""Don't worry. I got something"" (END OF WITNESS STATEMENT)

Based on the nature of the conversation, the Witness believes that XXXwas carrying a weapon inside the ""banana bag"".



It should be noted that I observed trespassed Lenox gang Associate, XXX retrieving a black bag from a gray Dodge van with Connecticut plates on a previous date (see FC20003354) which I described in the previous report as a black purse-like bag. 



 XXXalso wore the black purse-like or ""banana bag"" around his upper torso area.

 Another unidentified Subject whom I did not recognize was observed wearing a similar bag, brown in color, around his upper torso that same day. XXXand this Subject sat next to each other along the low wall at the edge of Ramsey Park accompanied by several other Associates.



 XXXwhom normally stares at me in a challenging/confrontational manner, was unusually passive and hardly looked in my direction during that observation as if attempting to avoid any unnecessary attention.

A Subject whom the Witness described as wearing a white t shirt and black pants was carrying what he previously described as a banana bag which he believed had a firearm in it based on previous statements made byXXXsee FC20003397).



 The Witness also described a black male wearing a red baseball cap sitting on the low wall at the edge of Ramsey Park next to another black male whom was shirtless with tattoos on his torso wearing white pants.



 The Witness stated that on Sunday June 21 2020 he previously overheard the shirtless male telling XXX that he could obtain a ""40 millimeter"" .



 The Witness stated that if I were to go to that location at that moment I would see who the tattooed Subject was.



 I was still in my personal vehicle on my way to report for duty and advised the Witness that I had not arrived for work yet.

 I ended up having to pass that location anyway due to construction work at the end of two of the streets that I normally use on my way in. 

As I passed the above location, I observedXXX sitting on the low wall at the edge of Ramsey park wearing a red baseball cap.



 Sitting next to XXXwas a shirtless Subject wearing a black baseball cap with tattoos on his torso wearing white pants.



This Subject's identity is not known to me but during previous interactions he has claimed to reside at XXXShawmut Ave #13 with his Grandmother. 



 There are no male names on the lease for that apartment but the tattooed Subject has been previously observed coming and going from apartment 13.



 As I was travelling down Kendall Street, I passed the Trotter Court parking lot and observed a light complexioned or hispanic male wearing a white t shirt and black pants as well as what appeared, at a glance, to be a small purse like or ""banana bag"" around his upper torso.



 I was not able to get a look at his face as I was still driving.



 At approximately 1405 hours I followed up with the Witness whom stated that the male with the white t shirt and black pants passed by him at the flag pole on Shawmut Ave (betwen XXXand XXXShawmut) at approximately 1400 hours and that there are cameras on the building that view that location.



 I advised the Witness that Longwood does not have access to those cameras as they still belong to the City of Boston (BHA and BRIC respectively) but that I would document his observations.



 At approximately 1550 hours I followed up with the Witness again and he stated that the Lenox Associates were all wearing white t-shirts today and that they had moved a group of homeless people whom usually sit at the tables in Ramsey Park across from 625 Shawmut over towards the baseball field. 



 The Witness stated that he talked to the homeless people and that they said the Lenox Associates were preparing for a ""shooting"". 



 The Witness stated that that XXX (whom he describes as the ""guy with the white Ford"") was directing all of the Lenox Associates to ""make sure the Cape Verdeans and Somalians are not in the park and to take up the area around the basketball/pick up soccer court because ""This is ours"" now. 



The Witness stated that many of the Associates have been leaning on the fence that separates the Lenox Apartments from the public sidewalk and that we should issue trespass orders against all of them so that they can all be arrested. 



 the Witness also expressed concern that the Lenox Associates may become emboldened by our lack of immediate action.



 I advised the Witness that there are legal limitations to what we can and can't do but encouraged him to keep contacting us so that we can document his observations and to immediately notify us or the Boston Police Department if an emergency occurs. 



 The Witness stated that he goes back to work next week and will not have time to keep monitoring the Lenox Associates.



 Nothing further.

 Witness stated Employee was picked up by a white city truck at approximately 0900.



 Witness stated that they later saw the kid with the backpack engaging with Lenox Associates in front of 618 Shawmut Ave and that they believe the kid's hostility toward the Employee is part of what they perceive as the gang's effort to establish control of the park.

Witness stated that at some point in the morning they encountered a homeless man whom they had not seen in approximately ten days.

Witness stated that the homeless man told them he and the other homeless people had been pushed towards the baseball field side of Ramsey Park by the Lenox Associates.

 The Driver refused to take the bandana before stating that he didn't need it because he would be right back.

 Witness stated that a group of Subjects he has previously reported (Lenox gang Associates) had propped the doorway to XXXShawmut Ave using a bicycle but dispersed prior to arrival.



 It should be noted that as Special Sgt. Richardi and I were proceeding to that location during an earlier call at approximately 1500 hrs we observed a recognized but unidentified Subject (black male with several tattoos known to stay at XXXShawmut #13) whom regularly associates with Lenox Associates coming from the direction of XXXShawmut Ave on a bicycle.



 As we were approaching, we also observed a trespassed Lenox Associate (XXX) standing on the public sidewalk outside of XXXShawmut looking towards the doorway as if interacting with someone. When XXXobserved us, he stated ""right on time"" before walking away.



 Shortly after that we passed trespassed Lenox Associates XXXand XXXcoming from the direction of the center path or XXXShawmut towards Shawmut Ave where they crossed the street and remained at the edge of Ramsey Park (see FC2003718)

 The Witness stated that on the previous evening (July 11 2020 2100 hrs) he heard a previously reported Subject proclaiming ""Man, I got my taser now"". The Witness described the Subject as one of the ""Enforcers"" whom he has previously described as talking loudly about ""shooting"" a lot. When asked, the Witness described the Subject as wearing all white.

Based on the Witnesses description of the Subject's behavior it sounded like he was describing trespassed Lenox Associate XXX(see FC20003367). 

 However, I was not able to corroborate this as our interactions/observations of these Subjects was limited on that date.



 The Witness stated that in recent days a previously reported/corroborated Lenox Associate, XXX(identity not known to the Witness), has been placing a chair on the sidewalk underneath a tree in the vicinity of XXXShawmut Ave surrounded by other Associates whom stand around him as he intermittently gives them directives.



 The Witness described the group's overall behavior as an assertion of authority.



 The Witness added that on the evening of July 11 2020 at approximately 2100 hours the Subjects were repeatedly setting off fireworks and blasting their music in the vicinity of the flag pole XXX-XXXShawmut Ave).



 It should be noted that at approximately 2145 hours Special Sgt. Richardi and I responded to that location for a noise complaint (see FC20003713) where we encountered trespassed Lenox Associate, XXXsitting on the grass outside of XXXShawmut next to a speaker with wires protruding from the second floor window of apartment 182 which is leased by an XXX.



 XXX has also been previously observed talking with XXXoutside of his apartment.



 I advised the Witness that he should continue to contact us when he observes this type of behavior. 

The Witness advised advised that he did not contact us as he was concerned that based on the statements of the Subject he overheard referring to tasers, he was afraid that these Subjects may have tasers that they could use to incapacitate and disarm us.



 I advised him that he should contact the Boston Police Department (BPD) which has resources available to address this anyway.



 I then encouraged the Witness to keep in contact.



 Nothing further.

 I asked the Witness to described the parties involved in the alleged incident. Witness stated that a ""younger"" male in a white t-shirt was striking and arguing with XXXearlier but that he did not see the Subject anymore.

 I then made contact with the above described male and female in front of XXXShawmut but both parties stated they had ""just got here"".

Operations updated the call to a person with a gun and stated that there was a male out front (no description given) with a gun. 

Upon arrival, Officers Woods and Hull (C202D) observed a large group of mostly females screaming outside of 1411 Blue Hill Ave. Officers observed a male quickly jog away from the group up the stairs. Given the description of a male with a gun, officers followed the male upstairs in an attempt to frisk him for weapons. As soon as officers began frisking the male, the group erupted and started screaming at the officers repeatedly and trying to interfere with officers. 

Other officers arrived on scene and tried multiple times to ask the parties what happened, if there was a fight, if there was an adult on scene, if anyone was injured, etc., however, no one would answer any questions. From speaking to the only adult on scene, a female neighbor that came over during the interaction, it was determined that there was no fight, but that another group of females showed up in an attempt to fight, and that there were no injuries. 

With regard to the gun, officers attempted to obtain information about the alleged person with a gun. One female, in between bouts of screaming at officers about being racist murderers, stated that a ""female with red hair"" had the gun. When Officer Scano asked the female, who would not give her name, what the female was wearing and what her name was, she stated, ""I aint a rat"" and refused to answer. 

Given that there were no victims, and that the group told officers repeatedly to leave and that they were not needed, officers left the scene.

 XXXwas observed reaching into the driver's side door of the interior of the Nissan and retrieving what was momentarily observed to be a small plastic bag (twisted on one end) containing what appeared to be a powdery substance.

The above described plastic bag was observed when XXXintentionally dropped it on the ground behind the Nissan and approached a recognized but unidentified Lenox Resident whom was standing on the sidewalk.



 XXXengaged in a hand to hand (presumably of currency) with the Resident whom then walked to the curb of the sidewalk and intentionally dropped his cane adjacent to the plastic bag.

 The Resident (black male 60s or 70s wearing a black Veteran's baseball cap) picked up the plastic bag and his cane before walking back on to the premises where he was observed by Spl. Sgt. Richardi entering XXXTrotter Court #251.

While conducting a code 19 at 950 American Legion Highway, officers heard a radio call made by an off-duty officer, known to the Commonwealth, that there was an unusual vehicle parked in front of another off-duty officer’s home. The vehicle was described as a black SUV, possibly a Mercedes-Benz or Ford Edge with an unknown plate. When the off-duty officer approached the area, the vehicle fled at a high rate of speed, over 100 mph, towards Hyde Park Avenue. 

After hearing the broadcasted description, Officers Pokrant and Decossa began to drive on Hyde Park Avenue, towards Cleary Square in attempts to locate the vehicle. As officers approached the area of 1012 Hyde Park Avenue, they observed a black SUV, with no headlights on, traveling towards them at an extremely high rate of speed. As the vehicle passed the officer’s cruiser, they observed the vehicle to be a black Ford Edge, bearing MA plate XXXAt that time, officers conducted a “U-turn”, activated their emergency equipment and attempted to conduct a traffic stop on the vehicle. At that time, the vehicle accelerated and did not stop for officers. It was apparent that officers were attempting to stop the black Ford Edge as there were no other vehicles traveling on Hyde Park Avenue in that direction at that time. 

Officers were traveling at approximately 58 mph when they determined that the continued efforts to stop the vehicle would be unsafe to all involved, including the public. At that time, officers deactivated their emergency equipment, slowed their speed to the speed limit and turned off of Hyde Park Avenue. Additionally, Sgt. Felton (L910) also called off any sort of pursuit of the vehicle. It should be noted that as this was happening, the suspect vehicle was continuing on Hyde Park Avenue at a speed estimated to be in excess of 100 mph with their lights off.
