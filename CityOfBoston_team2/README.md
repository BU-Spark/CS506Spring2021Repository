## Project Description

We would like to research the features that can make Boston a “15-minute city”, where essential services and resources are all within 15 minutes of each parcel in the city. Types of essential services within the city include:
<ul>
<li>Commercial</li>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Food access</li>
<li>Healthcare</li>
<li>Recreation</li>
<li>Social</li>
</ul>

We will target dense urban areas for the 15-minute city concept.  This will be done by identifying parcels of land in the city nearby or within areas with the highest concentration of essential services and then finding the shortest paths between them.  Then, the areas identified as 15-minute city sections will be displayed on a map to allow for identification of areas in need of more development of essential services.

Many cities such as [Melbourne](https://www.planning.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0033/487509/Living-Locally-20MN-in-Greenfield-Growth-Areas.pdf) that have implemented the plan seem to heavily emphasize bike lanes and access to parks in the scheme, so a worthwhile extra addition to the project might be identifying locations that can easily be integrated into wide bike lanes and potential public lands to be marked out for green spaces/parks. Further, the [C40 mayor’s report](https://www.c40.org/other/agenda-for-a-green-and-just-recovery) emphasizes the use of bike lanes as a post-COVID economic recovery idea to build more closely knit cities and improve accessibility and reduce the reliance on public transit and cars that posed a COVID risk for many.
