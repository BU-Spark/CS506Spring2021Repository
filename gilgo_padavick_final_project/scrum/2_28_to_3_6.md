# SCRUM Report 2/28 - 3/6
What have we worked on?
- Tested each api that we would like to use, including:
    - Alpha Vantage 
    - Yahoo Finance
    - Twitter 
    - Finnhub 
- Identified limiations in each API
- Performed preliminary analysis on price movement vs tweet volume

What do we plan to work on next week?
- Determine a format for data storage (e.g. how do we want to store twitter data) and upload clean data to github (most likely parquet files)
- Determine level of correlation between tweet volume and percent price change on known "pumped" stocks

Potential Roadblocks:
- Limitations on the number of api calls you can make with twitter. May need to batch data retrieval
