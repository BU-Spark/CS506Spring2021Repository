### Project Deliverable 2

More data should have been collected to perform a more thorough analysis of the data and attempt to answer one additional question relevant to your project proposal which you will submit as a pull request.

### Checklist
- [x] Collect and pre-process a secondary batch of data
- Through the Twitter API, we were able to pull down a breadth of features pertaining to each tweet. These features include information on tweets such as users, follower counts, how much a tweet was spread across the Twitter landscape, and much more.
- [x] Refine the preliminary analysis of the data performed in PD1
- In the PD1 submission, the preliminary data analysis was the proof of concept that we could plot the volume of tweets versus price action of a stock against one another to monitor trends. With that in mind, our goal for this deliverable was to break that tweet volume down further, showing through various visualizations what types of tweets and "tweeters" were tweeting at various times throughout the movement.
- [x] Answer another key question
- One of the key questions we sought to answer were "What were some of the biggest pump and dumps in the past year that were driven by social media?" We've listed a few below from their price pre-pump, the high the pump reached, and the current price today.
- KODK: From $2.09 - Up to $60.00 - Today is $7.65
- SHIP: From $2.48 - Up to $7.04 - Today is $1.08
- NKLA: From $13.10 - Up to $93.99 - Today is  $14.06
- [x] Refine project scope and list of limitations with data and potential risks of achieving project goal
- The largest limitations we have run into so far are primarily how many tweets the Twitter API will allow us to pull down at a given time. For example, when pulling the data for the GameStop tweets, the API only allowed us to pull a week's worth of tweets due to the high tweet volume it saw in early 2021. This does not bode well for "pump and dumps" that may have lasted over a months worth of time as seen on the stock price charts. Another issue is along with that tweet volume limitation, the API also will not allow us to go back further than the past 7 days to acquire tweets.
- To adjust to this, our scope will focus on one of two situtations. The first of these situation is to focus primarily on stocks that cover its market price action from pump to dump status in a week's time or less. The other option is choosing pump and dump stocks with a market capitalization value of less than $1M, which can be found mostly on the OTC (Over The Counter) market. Along with that, new pumps will have to be identified and studied each week to keep up with the API limitations.
- [x] Submit a PR with the above report and modifications to original proposal
