We currently have a scraper that extracts all of the URLs of the pages containing words from a list of search words we specified.

We created a scraper to extract the following basic info from a particular campaign:
- title
- organizer
- beneficiary
- date created
- location
- campaign tags
- number of followers
- number of donors
- number of shares
- amount raised compared to total goal (as a percentage)
- number of campaign updates 
- number of campaign comments

ChromeDriver is included, so the user does not have to change to their local path.
