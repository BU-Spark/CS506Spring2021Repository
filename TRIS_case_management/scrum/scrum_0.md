## Description of Change

CPCS provides legal representation in Massachusetts for those unable to afford an attorney in all matters in which the law requires the appointment of counsel. This includes representation in criminal, delinquency, youthful offender, child welfare, mental health, sexually dangerous person and sex offender registry cases, as well as related appeals and post-conviction matters. The present project focuses on young people (up to age 18) accused of committing various crimes.

This cohort is represented by CPCSâ€™ Youth Advocacy Division (YAD) who work within the Massachusetts juvenile justice system. YAD represents court-involved youth and partners with the Education Law Project (EdLaw) practice that focuses on youth entangled in school-based discipline.
