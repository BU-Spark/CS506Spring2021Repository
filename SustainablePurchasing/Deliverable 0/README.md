## Project Deliverable 0

Teams should have set up weekly meetings with their client for the remainder of the semester,  reviewed the project scope, and submitted a pull request with the revised and final project description.

### Discussion and Limitations
1.  We only focus on toner and coffee consumption for investigating sustainable purchasing, not so much freedom.  
2.  It may be challenging to trace the GHG footprint of toner since we need to scrape some information from the merchants, not sure if they publish the details online.  
3.  Right now we only have “WB Mason Toner and Coffee Purchases_no pricing” data at hand and the valuable attributes are “date”, “ERP Supplier”, “Product Description” and “Category”. There’s not many numeric attributes to work on and we need to find a way to separate and classify the non-numeric attributes.  
We don’t have direct access to the original resources. Everytime we apply for the data, we need to wait for the clients’ replies, which leads to delay in progress. 
4.  Note: The client is looking for a full-featured database for the prospective students, so we should have an eye on what else data we need in order to realize a comprehensive report in the end.
