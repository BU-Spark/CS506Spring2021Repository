### Project Description

The goal for the project is to explore the working supplies requests and expenditure from BU staff based on which we analyze the waste volume and GHG emission of the main categories (i.e. Coffee and Ink Cartridge) and their subcategories. According to the analysis, we are expected to provide some insightful suggestions regarding to BU sustainability in the future.


### Analysis Questions

* What is the waste volume of the specified categories?
* what is the weight of the waste to represent the waste volume of the products and use some carbon emission of the main material to represent product emission?
* What are ways the University could ask the vendors to change the options they offer ? e.g. buy less K-cup, more bag coffee
* What is the difference between the weight of each componets for the coffee and creamer waste

### Deliverable 1

Procedure:
We removed all data which has "Unclassified" value at the column for "Part - Supplier Part Number".
We have calculated the number of requests for coffee and toner quarterly, monthly and yearly, and visualized the trends through ploting lines and bars.
We have plotted pie charts for reavealing the top 20 coffee products and top 20 toner products respectively with the most number of requestes within 5 years and visualized their request numbers through the histogram.
We found average waste value for plastic K-Cup Pods from online open source and estimated value for Coffee Creamer from Amazon to calculate waste weights for the top 20 coffee products with the most number of requests.

Conclusion: 
In the recent five years, the total waste weight for the top 18 different types of K-cups with the most total number is 1.512 tons, and the total waste for the top 2 different types of coffee creamer with the most total number is 0.4 kg.

### Deliverable 2

Procedure:

* We have collected the packing type, weight and carbon emissions (if possible) for top 10 ground coffee, top 10 coffee creamer and top 10 K-Cup products in quantity from the categories of our previous analysis.

* We have collected the total weight, size, weight of toner and carbon emissions (if possible) for top 10 ink cartridge in quantity.

* We have received a secondary batch of data about the toner and coffee requests from different BU departments and do some pre-process of the data.

Conclusion:
We answered the following question:
* Total waste weight for top 10 K-Cup Coffee
* Total waste weight for the top two creams


### Data description

We have received three batch of data from clients. 
* First part of data is about the list of things that the University purchases every year. Most of them are coffee and toner. That data contains each singal request that the university have. Our clients tell us that toner and coffee are two main components that university uses. 
* Second data batch is about the number of toner and paper that the office request each year. We call it WBMason Paper and Toner. This is mainly because we find the the papaer and toner are two main contribuctors of the green house gas. 
* Last, we ask our clients to provide the list of different departments and colleges. We want to find out the pattern of different apaprtment request to find a solution to reduce the green house gas. In this dataset, we have different data with different apartment so we can try to find the frequency of different apartment to answer the key question of our peoject.
