### Project Deliverable 3 (v1 Final Report)

All data should have been collected. All project questions should have been reviewed, answered, and submitted in a written document outlining findings as a PR. You will also be asked to submit the associated data and a README explaining what each label/feature in your dataset represents. Your team should meet with the client before this deliverable.

#### Checklist

- [ ] Answer another key question
- [ ] Attempt to answer overarching project question
- [ ] Create a draft of your final report
- [ ] Refine project scope and list of limitations with data and potential risks of achieving project goal
- [ ] Submit a PR with the above report and modifications to original proposal

#### Project Question

* What is the waste volume of the specified categories?
* what is the weight of the waste to represent the waste volume of the products and use some carbon emission of the main material to represent product emission?
* What are ways the University could ask the vendors to change the options they offer ? e.g. buy less K-cup, more bag coffee

#### Deliverable 1

Procedure:
We removed all data which has "Unclassified" value at the column for "Part - Supplier Part Number".
We have calculated the number of requests for coffee and toner quarterly, monthly and yearly, and visualized the trends through ploting lines and bars.
We have plotted pie charts for reavealing the top 20 coffee products and top 20 toner products respectively with the most number of requestes within 5 years and visualized their request numbers through the histogram.
We found average waste value for plastic K-Cup Pods from online open source and estimated value for Coffee Creamer from Amazon to calculate waste weights for the top 20 coffee products with the most number of requests.

Conclusion: 
In the recent five years, the total waste weight for the top 18 different types of K-cups with the most total number is 1.512 tons, and the total waste for the top 2 different types of coffee creamer with the most total number is 0.4 kg.

#### Deliverable 2

Procedure:
*We have collected the packing type, weight and carbon emissions (if possible) for top 10 ground coffee, top 10 coffee creamer and top 10 K-Cup products in quantity from the categories of our previous analysis.

*We have collected the total weight, size, weight of toner and carbon emissions (if possible) for top 10 ink cartridge in quantity.

*We have received a secondary batch of data about the toner and coffee requests from different BU departments and do some pre-process of the data.


#### Data description

We have received three batch of data from clients. 
* First part of data is about the list of things that the University purchases every year. Most of them are coffee and toner. That data contains each singal request that the university have. Our clients tell us that toner and coffee are two main components that university uses. 
* Second data batch is about the number of toner and paper that the office request each year. We call it WBMason Paper and Toner. The client This is mainly because we find the the papaer and toner are two main contribuctors of the green house gas. 
* Last, we ask our clients to provide the list of different departments and colleges. We want to find out the pattern of different apaprtment request to find a solution to reduce the green house gas.
