#### Project Question

* What is the waste volume of the specified categories?
* what is the weight of the waste to represent the waste volume of the products and use some carbon emission of the main material to represent product emission?

#### Deliverable 1

We removed all data which has "Unclassified" value at the column for "Part - Supplier Part Number".
We have calculated the number of requests for coffee and toner quarterly, monthly and yearly, and visualized the trends through ploting lines and bars.
We have plotted pie charts for reavealing the top 20 coffee products and top 20 toner products respectively with the most number of requestes within 5 years and visualized their request numbers through the histogram.
We found average waste value for plastic K-Cup Pods from online open source and estimated value for Coffee Creamer from Amazon to calculate waste weights for the top 20 coffee products with the most number of requests.

Conclusion: 
* In the recent five years, the total waste weight for the top 18 different types of K-cups with the most total number is 1.512 tons, and the total waste for the top 2 different types of coffee creamer with the most total number is 0.4 kg.
