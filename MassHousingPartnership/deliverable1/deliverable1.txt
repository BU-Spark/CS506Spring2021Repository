Project Deliverable 1

Client wanted a process to find the density of address per parcel using the MA addresses and MA parcels datasets.
    For this deliverable, we developed a scaled-down process to combine the address and parcel datasets using Shapley.
    Our process loaded the address and parcel data from Quincy and generated the density of addresses per parcel.


Sufficient data should have been collected to perform a preliminary analysis of the data and attempt to answer one question relevant to your project proposal which you will submit as a pull request. If data has already been collected for your project you must answer two questions.
