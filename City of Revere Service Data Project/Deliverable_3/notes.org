Xavier's Notes

* General goals
** get lat longs of DPW into census groups (or tracts?) I forget
** use [[https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B09019&geo_ids=140|06000US2502556585,150|06000US2502556585,060|05000US25025&primary_geo_id=06000US2502556585][this website]] to get shapefiles along with demographics data along with shapefiles
** To figure out what demographics data is available, you may use [[https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/comparing-acs-data/2008/crosswalk-table.html/content/census/en/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/comparing-acs-data/2008/crosswalk-table.html][this "crosswalk" table website]]
