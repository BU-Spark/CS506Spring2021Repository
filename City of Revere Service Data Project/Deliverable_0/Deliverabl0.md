# City of Revere Service Data 

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to correlate publicly available demographic data about the City of Revere with a variety of public works data. The main focus of this project is ensuring that city resources are being utilized by all residents of Revere, and identify any pattern of unequal access to or application of said resources. Our hope is this project provides us good information about disparate city services, whether deliberate or incidental, that helps drive some decision-making and reallocation of city staff and resources if found needed. There may also be an opportunity to present this data both to the Mayor and to the city's Human Rights Commission.

## Meeting Schedule
Every week on Wednesday from 1:00 pm - 2:30 pm, Reuben will attend every other week

## Data Sources
The demographic data will come from recent census data. 311, public works, parking tickets and housing violations will come from the city via Reuben.

## Project Scope
Correlate demographic location data from 2018 onward from the census with where people are requesting help from the city and where the public works funds are going.

## Questions to be answered
What are the most important datasets, and what data could be very useful if the group had it?
How can the demographic data collected by past research groups help this investigation?
If any, which resources are being unequally used by citizens with respect to race/income?
Which metric do we use to rank any disparities in government service that we find ?
What does the research on discrepancies in city resources suggest we should look?
What are other cities around the nation and world looking into data-wise to improve resource distribution?

## Methods
- Scraping using some combination of Selenium, BS4, requests.
- Most data cleaning will be done through pandas.
-Static visualization will come primarily from matplotlib and dynamic maps from Bokeh/Leaflet. Interactive Charts with Chart.Js.

## Limitations
Limitations include
1. Some city data may not be publicly available which would make it difficult to draw meaningful correlations. 
2. “Zones” of the city in different data sets may not line up
3. Data may be inconsistently curated/collected in different zones (collection bias)
4. Unforeseen extraneous variables might yield inaccurate results
