# Deliverable 0
Weekly meetings: Thursdays, 3:15-4:00 pm. Yifu and Lance are welcome to join whenever.

# Project Limitations
- Companies may not form into distinct 'risk clusters'.
- Even if companies form distinct clusters (based on cosine similarity -> 10-K paragraphs), we may see no financial trends when comparing among clusters.
- Companies of interest may not have 10-K filings (e.g., a newer company which had an initial public offering less than a year ago, thus has only filed 10-Qs).
- 10-K format diversity (e.g., some companies may have verbose narratives while other companies have bullet points).

# Update
We have already made progress in extracting company 10-Ks from EDGAR (the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system). On [02/18/21] we met and planned how to develop an HTML parser.
