# What have I worked on?
- I've been refining our html_parser.py and developed our topic_models.py (which executes LDA)
- Ran preliminary tests on LDA function-- need to expand topic model to consider multiple companies

# What will I be working on next?
- Help Nick on increasing throughput of html_parser (which will then feed LDA model)

# Have I run into any issues? Do I need help?
- No issues yet

# Have I talked to the client recently? When are we meeting with them next?
- Meetings have been scheduled with Yifu: Tuesdays 4:30pm
