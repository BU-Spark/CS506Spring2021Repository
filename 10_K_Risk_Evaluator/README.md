# Categorizing Companies by Stated Risk Factors in 10-K Filings

# Project Description
We developed web-scraping, text parsing, and sentiment analysis tools that operated on documents from EDGAR, a database hosted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Our analytical pipeline could aggregate text sections from 10-K filings, which enabled the development of both supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. We analyzed whether underlying sentiments in 10-K paragraphs could indicate a company’s general risk profile, and thus predict how companies were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Overall, our project successfully processed limited, heterogeneous data (e.g. unique company 10-K HTML file structures) and produced preliminary insights through multiple models. Our analysis revealed that biotech companies in 2020 faced similar self reported risks compared to 2019.
