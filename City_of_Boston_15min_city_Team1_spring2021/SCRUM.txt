For deliverable 0, week1 :
All materials (mainly datasets) have been reviewed. Scope of the project is not yet revised. 
We need to know whether a revision is necessary after meeting with our client. The meeting is this Thursday.
Questions like the 1st one in the limitation list are to be asked during the meeting.


For deliverable 1, week 2:
We have been working on preprocessing the collected dataset. The dataset from Boston Master Business and establishments dataset are combined with Grocers dataset from MAPC. 
For Environmental justice demographics, since it is a map dataset, we do not plan to combine it at this step; what we plan to do is to compare it with our result in the end.
We are still waiting for datasets on green space from the client. 
In next step, we will try to visualize the data we already have. 
We still need to know the exact definition of a "parcel" and we are trying to know more about Google map API, which may be useful later. 
We are supposed to meet the client and PM again next week.

Week 3:
We are currently working on the parcel dataset and open space dataset. 
We have been discussing efficient algorithms for the final task, and should be able to implement it after meeting of group members on Monday.

Week 4, for deliverable 2:
We have implemented the algorithm for a small sample of the data and have done some analysis. Details are in deliverable 2.
For next steps, we will repeat the steps on the whole dataset after refining the dataset (if necessary), and do demongraphic research.

Week 5:
We have collected all the data and get all the codes; the only thing left is to do analysis on the results we get and produce a report.

Week 6:
All data processed. Need to contact client for next step (e.g. refine the results).
