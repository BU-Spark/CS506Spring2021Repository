In my judgment, CF&GPA should be permitted to make its application to the Town of Lancaster before judgment is rendered in this Action, so that CF&GPA's argument that its use is exempted under G.L. c.40A, sec. 3 may be fully ripe for adjudication.  It is my belief that such an allowance by the Court will avoid wasting judicial resources, and will ultimately be the most efficient means possible for reaching a final disposition in this case, and for that reason, it is my hope that this matter may proceed accordingly.""",4,Agreement for Judgment
