# CS 506 - Final Project Repository

## Project Deliverable 3

- [x] Collect and pre-process a preliminary batch of data
  - 60 days prior Weather Data collected from oikolab API for every Tornado
  - Data organized based on specific Tornado
- [x] Perform a preliminary analysis of the data
  - Created graphs for showing each weather data feature vs time
- [x] Answer one key question
  - Are there any weather conditions that seem to lead to tornado's occuring
    - Based on the graphs developed there is a positive linear relationship with the increase in weather with tornados occuring
- [x] Refine project scope and list of limitations with data and potential risks of achieving project goal
- [x] Submit a PR with the above report and modifications to original proposal
  - [Proposal](Project_Proposal_CS506.md)


- [x] All data is collected
  - Gathered random weather data to compare agaisnt the tornado data to prepare models
- [x] Refine the preliminary analysis of the data performed in PD1&2
  - Calculated slopes and averages of the data to create features for modeling
- [x] Answer another key question
  - When predicting tornados, the features that lead to the highest prediction accuracy where the temperature slope and radiation slope
- [x] Attempt to answer overarching project question
  - We can somewhat accurately depict trends in the weather data leading up to tornados which allows for a useful probability score for users.
- [ ] Create a draft of your final report
- [x] Refine project scope and list of limitations with data and potential risks of achieving project goal
- [x] Submit a PR with the above report and modifications to original proposal
