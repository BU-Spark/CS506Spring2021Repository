A storm spotter observed the tornado as it passed southeast of Cee Vee at approximately 19:05 CST, and described it visually as a large wedge-shaped vortex.  A post-storm ground and aerial survey conducted by local emergency management officials and National Weather Service meteorologists concluded that the tornado resulted in significant EF-3 damage.||A number light weight objects and structures, including well-houses, horse stables, utility poles, empty semi-truck trailers, and a partially filled petroleum tank were heavily damaged or destroyed along the initial portions of the tornado's track through ranchland southwest and south of Cee Vee.  This includes minor roof damage to a permanent farm home near County Road 172.  ||Significant damage first occurred at a farmstead 3 miles east-southeast of Cee Vee, south of Farm to Market Road 1440.  At this site, upwards of twenty-percent of the roof was removed from a well-built permanent home.  A large metal building was partially collapsed and a well-house was completely destroyed.  A horse trailer was blown over and rolled.  In addition, several large trees were uprooted.||The tornado continued to move northeastward and impacted a second farmstead four miles east of Cee Vee, just south of Farm to Market Road 1440.  The tornado's maximum damage intensity was observed at this site, where a well-built stucco constructed permanant home, a cinderblock two-car garage, and several outbuildings were destroyed.  The home's roof was totally removed, and three exterior walls collapsed.  A portion of the home's roof and exterior walls were blown downwind and struck the two-car cinderblock garage broadside.  This contributed to the complete destruction of that structure with only the frames of two exterior walls remaining.  Two outbuildings and a horse stable were completely destroyed, with another unroofed.  In addition, an entire stand of more than a dozen large trees were uprooted.  A detailed survey by local officials of the site, revealed that the home was well-built, and that the exterior walls were secured to the slab foundation with bolts.||In collaboration with experts at Texas Tech University's Wind Engineering Department, the developers of the Enhanced-Fujita Scale, it was determined that estimated wind speeds at the site of the destroyed residence ranged between 130 and 150 mph.  With an average expected wind speed of 140 mph, the tornado was assigned an EF-3 rating based on this damage.||The tornado continued northeastward across Farm to Market Road 1440.  It caused light roof damage to a couple of light weight structures before dissipating just west of U.S. Highway 62/83 east-northeast of Cee Vee at approximately 19:20 CST.||Despite damaging three residences, no injuries were reported.","Scattered thunderstorms developed over the central and eastern South Plains region of west Texas during the late afternoon and evening hours of the 22nd.  These storms resulted in significant severe weather, including strong tornadoes, as they impacted portions of the extreme southeastern Panhandle and the Rolling Plains. |The severe weather over the South Plains of west Texas on the 22nd was part of a larger tornado outbreak that impacted areas from west Texas northward through western Kansas and eastern Colorado.||Thunderstorms initiated over the central South Plains along and east of a dryline late in the day.  These storms, some exhibiting supercell characteristics, initially became severe and produced large hail and damaging winds before 18:00 CST.  By 18:20 CST, the first of three tornadoes, two of which were long-lived and significant, developed over northeastern Motley County.  The parent supercell thunderstorm produced two damaging and rain-wrapped tornadoes over portions of Motley and Cottle Counties.  The initial tornado south of Northfield crossed the Motley and Cottle County line southwest of Cee Vee.  This three-quarter mile wide EF-2 tornado destroyed windmills and utility poles as it tracked through rural ranchlands.  The second tornado heavily damaged or destroyed three farmsteads south and southeast of Cee Vee (Cottle County).  Winds were estimated at approximately 140 mph where one home was destroyed east of that community.  No injuries were reported.||A second supercell thunderstorm developed south of the initial tornadic storm, and became tornadic near Swearingen (Cottle County) shortly after 21:00 CST.||In addition to tornadoes, numerous reports of large hail up to the size of baseballs were received.  Another Cottle County home was heavily damaged by thunderstorm winds just north of Paducah as convection organized into a linear complex late in the evening.  Also, training thunderstorms repeatedly moved over the Tahoka area in Lynn County.  This resulted in areas of flooding and portions of two U.S. Highways were rendered impassable.||In all, property damages were estimated at $530,000.  No injuries were reported.",4

The hardest hit areas were between CR 117 and CR 106, just to the south southeast of Mentone. The most significant damage occurred to a trailer park (Morning Glory Court) where several single wide manufactured homes were completely destroyed. Numerous large trees were also snapped or uprooted.  The tornado continued moving northeast and crossed into Chattooga county (Northwest Georgia) around 11:34 PM CDT.  Additional damage occurred as it traveled another 8 miles into northern Chattooga county.","Four damaging tornadoes tore tracks through north central and northeast Alabama during the evening and overnight hours of the 24th.   These tornadoes were part of a larger regional tornado outbreak across the lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys.   The tornadoes were associated with three separate long track supercell thunderstorms that thrived upon a very unstable and high shear environment.  One of the longer track tornadoes tore through several successive communities with up to EF-3 strength in Marshall and DeKalb Counties, including the towns of Albertville, Geraldine and Pine Ridge, lifting just before reaching Fort Payne.  A tornado from the same storm then touched down again in the Mentone area before crossing the Georgia state line.  Another supercell produced yet another tornado southwest of Collinsville, tracking just a few miles south of the earlier damaging tornado.  This tornado reached EF-4 strength when it completely leveled the McNutt United Methodist Church on County Road 55.    Fortunately, no fatalities occurred with these particular tornadoes, but damages were severe.||In Marshall County, total costs from the tornado had exceeded $14 million, which included 1032 homes experiencing at least some damage, and 93 homes destroyed.

A 56 year old female was killed by flying debris while driving her car on State Route 795 near the school complex.  The woman's daughters were following in another car which was also destroyed.  The daughters both sustained minor injuries.  The tornado continued east northeast and crossed Interstate 280 just north of the State Route 795 interchange before moving across open fields for about a mile.  The tornado may have briefly weakened to EF2 intensity, but then strengthened back to EF3 intensity as it crossed Bradner Road to the west of Millbury.  The tornado destroyed several homes in a neighborhood bordered by Bradner Road to the west and Cherry Street to the south.  A 47 year old man was killed in house on Case Road in this neighborhood.  The man's daughter was the valedictorian of the graduating senior class at Lake High School which was destroyed by the tornado.  The tornado then intensified to EF4 as it approached Main Street on the north side of Millbury.  Over a dozen homes were destroyed or heavily damaged along Main Street.  A 36 year old woman and her four year old son were killed in one of the destroyed homes on Main Street.  The woman's 37 year old husband died on June 12th from injuries sustained from the tornado.  Several more homes were destroyed or heavily damaged on Hille Drive and Woodville Road before the tornado crossed North Fostoria Road and moved into Ottawa County as a weak EF3 or strong EF2 tornado.   This tornado was on the ground for around six and a half miles in Wood County and destroyed or heavily damaged over 60 homes.  Dozens of additional homes sustained minor damage with another couple hundred homes affected by the storm.  Dozens of vehicles were also destroyed.  Hundreds of trees were toppled or snapped by the tornado along the damage path which was up to 400 yards in width.  The tornado debarked some of the larger trees along the damage path.  At least one high tension utility pole was toppled by the tornado and widespread power outages occurred in Millbury and Walbridge.   Damage to the Lake Township infrastructure was estimated at five million dollars with tens of millions of losses to the Lake Local School District. The exact number of injuries caused by this tornado is unknown, but at least 17 people had to be hospitalized in nearby Toledo.

A third round of storms developed during the early morning hours of the 6th ahead of a cold front trailing the low.  These storms moved across northern Ohio and produced pockets of damage.  An EF1 tornado occurred in Ashtabula County around daybreak.  A total of five tornadoes occurred in northern Ohio on June 5th and 6th.  These tornadoes killed seven people, injured dozens and destroyed or damaged over a 100 homes.  A school and a public administration building were also leveled.

The supercell thunderstorm developed strong rotation, and rotating wall clouds and brief funnel clouds were reported in Daniels County.  As the storm moved southeast, it intensified and a large, long-lived tornado formed.  The tornado traveled for 18 miles, mostly through rural areas, but it had devastating impacts as it hit a ranch, killing two people and injuring one.   On the morning of July 27th, 2010 two teams of NWS Glasgow staff surveyed the damage area.  The first team started in Daniels County and followed the track of the storm to the east-southeast.   The second team met with county and state officials at the site of the ranch that was most devastated.   Both teams spoke to law enforcement officials, as well as weather spotters and the public who had reports of weather and/or damage as well as those who saw the tornado.   ||The initial damage from the tornado originated about 12 miles south of Redstone.   Along the Reserve and Wanso Roads, six miles of power lines were snapped off.  Sheridan Electric was able to restore power fairly quickly to the majority of residences by the next morning.

This was the widest portion of the tornado track with a width of a half mile.||The tornado continued east-southeast where it encountered an abandoned farmhouse, a barn and a bridge that went across Wolf Creek on the Three Corners Road.  The bridge had the planks ripped off with damage totals coming to $100,000.  The farmhouse was blown off of the foundation, had some of the siding stripped off, and roof damage.  The barn was completely destroyed, with the west and north facing walls blown away, and the south and east facing walls intact for the most part, but flattened on the ground.

This outbreak brought 13 tornadoes to the forecast area. This occurred as potent storm system moved out of the Rockies and developed a strong area of low pressure across the Central Plains. This surface low caused a warm front to take shape and quickly lift northward across the forecast during the afternoon of the 29th. Warm and humid conditions pushed north, which led to unstable conditions over the region just ahead of the advancing strong cold front. The wind energy through the atmosphere was strong. The resulting wind shear (change in wind speed or direction with height) was strong and very favorable for rotating storms and supporting tornadoes. As the clash of systems occurred, a mix of supercell thunderstorms developed, along with a broken line of thunderstorms. A handful of these storms utilized the strong wind shear present and produced tornadoes. Overall, 13 tornadoes occurred with 5 being of the strong variety (EF2-EF3). The strongest tornado occurred over northwest Leake and southern Attala Counties. Here, an EF3 moved along a 10 mile path and destroyed numerous mobile homes, 6 people were injured. Four other strong tornadoes occurred and were all rated EF2. Two of these occurred in Yazoo County, one just southwest of Yazoo City and the other in Downtown Yazoo City.

A deep trough formed aloft over the southeast U.S. with a strong southwest flow setting up over Iowa at all levels.  During the afternoon and evening, the low level jet increased steadily and reached 50 to 70 kts by midnight.  Considerable moisture advection took place with surface dewpoints rising into the low to middle 60s by evening.  A strong warm front lifted north into Iowa during the afternoon.  By the early evening hours it extended from west central Iowa into the east central and southeast counties of the state.  This front served as a focusing mechanism for thunderstorm development.  A strong elevated mixed layer was in place over the state during the afternoon of the 9th.  This kept convection from developing until the evening hours.  The freezing level was quite high for mid April, around 13,000 feet.  By early evening, at the initiation of storm development, the atmosphere had become very unstable.  Lifted indices were in the -9 to -12 C range with elevated CAPE feeding into the state in the 3000 to 5000 J/kg range.  The atmosphere was very sheared with effective shear of 60 to 65 kts.  As the moisture increased, precipitable water values increased to between 0.8 and 1.1 inches.  There was considerable downdraft CAPE available, with 1100 J/kg available.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was between 500 and 1000 J/kg.  The effective helicity in the low layers of the atmosphere was around 800 J/Kg.  The LCL was around 1250 meters.  Thunderstorms developed along the warm frontal boundary during the very late afternoon and evening hours.  The storms formed more as discrete supercells rather than forming into a line.  The strongest supercells moved through Onawa County along the northern Crawford County line into Sac County.  Another strong supercell moved through Kossuth County.  In addition to the tornadoes that occurred, there were scattered reports of hail ranging from golf ball to baseball size with the storms.  There were a few reports of wind damage, however most of the damage that occurred was tornadic in nature.  On the north edge of the storms, what appeared to be a gravity wave lifted northeast along the back side of the line.  It produced a wind gust of near 60 MPH for a short period of time in Emmet County.  Several tornadoes touched down across western into northwest Iowa.  In Sac County, an EF3 tornado touched down with peak winds of 140 MPH. The path length was about 13 miles long and reached a mile in width at its widest.  The tornado began north of Odebolt and ended about 6 miles northwest of Early.  Damage was done to a farmstead and one home was totally destroyed.  Shortly before that, a tornado touched down in Crawford County from northwest of Ricketts to to about 4 miles northeast of Schleswig.  Damage was done to farmsteads along its path.   Another tornado touched down in Sac County northwest of Odeboldt and tracked to just northeast of Early.  This tornado had winds of 132 MPH, EF2 strength, with a half mile wide peak width.  It was on the ground for about 13 miles.  In what was the longest tornado track of the day, about 30 miles in length, a tornado touched down just west of Nemaha and tracked to about 3 1/2 miles southwest of Havelock through Sac, Buena Vista, and Pocahontas Counties.  The tornado was EF3 in strength and had a peak width of 2 to 3 miles.  Major damage occurred along the route with hog buildings destroyed, several farmsteads damaged or destroyed, and residential damage reported.  A turkey containment was destroyed, with the building completely removed.  Numerous hogs died in the tornado was well.  There were at least 4 satellite tornadoes associated with this long track tornado.  Two of the satellite tornadoes were a cyclonic/anticyclonic pair as they pushed north into Pocahontas County.  Another tornado, related to the same parent cell, tracked southeast and crossed paths with the long track tornado in Pocahontas County.  This tornado had peak winds of 170 MPH and was rated EF4.  Several farmsteads were destroyed by the tornado.  The path width was nearly 600 yards wide.  Yet another tornado touched down in Sac County northwest of Nemaha, and tracked to about 9 miles northeast of Nemaha.  It was on the ground for about 12 miles and had a peak width of 1/2 mile.  Damage was done to farms and a hog confinement building.  In Kossuth County, a tornado touched down briefly south of Algona and was on the ground for about a mile.  It was 200 yards wide and was EF1 strength with 90 MPH winds.  A smaller tornado touched down briefly southwest of Algona in Kossuth County.  Damage occurred to a hog confinement building and to power lines.  Following the NWS storm survey, there were two other tracks of EF-0 strength tornadoes discovered.  One occurred in farm fields of Sac County, north-northwest of Odebolt.  The path was about a mile long and 200 yards wide at its widest, with peak winds estimated at 65 MPH.  The tornado had an erratic track which actually looped back on itself.  Another tornado touched down in farm fields in Pocahontas County.  It was also an EF-0 tornado with a path length of about 2.5 miles and maximum width of 250 yards.  Winds with the tornado were around 100 MPH.  Governor Terry Branstad proclaimed a State Disaster Declaration for Buena Vista, Sac, Calhoun, and Pocahontas Counties.",71

The storm system strengthened as it moved east of the Rocky mountains, eventually becoming a major storm system, with blizzard conditions on the west and north sides of it, and powerful thunderstorms to the south and east. A surface low pressure moved from the Texas panhandle into southern Kansas, with a dry line extending to the south. The dry line moved quickly east before slowing to the east of I-35 in Oklahoma. Dew point temperatures reached the middle 60s east of the dry line, with bone-dry conditions advecting in on the back side of the dry line. The cap that was in place was all but erased by mid afternoon, and thunderstorms quickly developed over eastern Oklahoma. The wind shear in place was more than sufficient for rotating thunderstorms, with most storms become supercells. Very large hail and wind damage was common early in the thunderstorm life cycle. A weak tornado developed northwest of Stroud, with other storms showing signs of rotation by late afternoon. Additional tornadoes developed through the early evening, with a couple of them doing damage. The tornadoes were in addition to the hail up to softball size.

The tornado continued to track northeastward and caused extensive tree damage and damage to numerous homes, mainly from fallen trees along Pierce Olive, Ten-Ten, Penny Road, and Yates Mill Pond roads, as wind speeds increased to around 100 mph. The tornado crossed Tryon Road, between Lake Wheeler Road and the Raleigh Golf Association Golf Course, before tracking northeast across the entire City of Raleigh, producing EF1 damage in a narrow swath between 50 to 100 yards. It crossed directly over Interstates 40-440, between exits 297 and 298 with damage on both sides of the interstate clearly visible. The tornado continued northeast across South Saunders Street, where 4 businesses were damaged. A body shop was completely destroyed when the roof was ripped off and the side walls collapsed. The tornado continued to snap hardwood trees and power-lines near Mount Hope Cemetery and nearby homes. The tornado weakened as it moved northeast towards Shaw University. Campus dormitories and the university student center had windows blown in with roof damage. The tornado moved northeast along the east side of the major high rise buildings in downtown Raleigh, downing hundreds of trees, many of which fell on houses. The historic Oakwood to Lion`s Park sections of town, including the historic Oakwood Cemetery were hardest hit. Also in the path of the tornado was Saint Augustine`s College, which sustained roof damage to every building on campus. The tornado continued to down trees on numerous homes as it crossed North King Charles Road to Yonkers Road, producing EF1 damage to several businesses.  The tornado crossed the 440 beltline for a second time, this time on the northeast side of downtown Raleigh near the intersections of Westinghouse and Brentwood roads, again causing damages to several businesses, including the Raleigh Iceplex. The tornado then strengthened to an EF2 with winds greater than 110 mph as it continued northeast producing extensive tree damage in a 100 to 200 yard wide path from Stony Brook Drive to Buffalo Road. Snapped trees crashed onto and through numerous homes all along the path. Four fatalities occurred when a large tree fell|onto a mobile home. Two other mobile homes were thrown 30 to 50 feet when the tie downs snapped from their anchor points with nearly all of the mobile homes in the Stony Brook mobile home park sustained some type of damage.  The EF2 tornado continued to move northeast across Buffalo Road, near the Cardinal Grove Subdivision. Several two story homes were completely destroyed with numerous other homes sustaining moderate to major damage. Damage consistent with an EF2 tornado continued with widespread damage in a 200 yard wide swath along Forestville road. A couple of mobile homes were destroyed and several two story homes suffered extensive roof damage, with continued numerous snapped trees falling on houses. The tornado weakened or lifted as it moved northeast towards Rolesville. Damage became very sporadic and isolated in nature as it neared the Franklin County line. In total, 2270 homes were damaged, including 67 homes that were destroyed, with another 184 homes experiencing major damage. There were also 34 businesses damaged.","A strong storm system that had a history of producing deadly tornadoes across Oklahoma and the deep south on the 14th and 15th weakened as it crossed the southern Appalachians during the early morning hours of the 16th.

The event ramped up again during the early afternoon of April 27th continuing into the early evening.  The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 23 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 23, 12 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.||By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi.

Many thousands of trees were snapped or uprooted along the path of this tornado. Numerous roofs of homes were severely damaged. Numerous mobile homes were severely damaged and several mobile homes were completely destroyed. Numerous barns and sheds received heavy damage or were destroyed. Numerous power poles and power lines were down. Extensive damage occurred to a school in Cumberland, Webster County, and this was the basis for the EF-3 rating. Maximum winds were around 140 mph. Total path length across Choctaw, Webster, Clay, Chickasaw, and Monroe Counties was 59 miles.","A historic outbreak of tornadoes across the Ark-La-Miss began late on Tuesday, April 26th continuing into the early morning hours of Wednesday, April 27th. The event ramped up again during the early afternoon of April 27th continuing into the early evening.  The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 23 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 23, 12 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.||By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi.

The event ramped up again during the early afternoon of April 27th continuing into the early evening.  The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 23 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 23, 12 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.||By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi. It did not take long for these storms to take on ���classic��� supercell structures and begin producing tornadoes. The first tornado of the afternoon started in Neshoba County on the north side of Philadelphia. This tornado ended up producing EF-5 damage and tracked for 29 miles across Neshoba, Kemper, Winston and Noxubee Counties. Through the rest of the afteroon multiple tornadoes developed, stemming from multiple supercell storms. Nearly all of the storms produced tornadoes, with many of them long track and significant. The other violent tornado to impact the Jackson, MS forecast area occurred across Smith, Jasper, and Clarke Counties. This tornado continued into Alabama and had a total path length of 124 miles across both states.||Loss of life during this historic event was staggering.

Maximum estimated wind speeds were 130 mph.","A historic outbreak of tornadoes across the Ark-La-Miss began late on Tuesday, April 26th continuing into the early morning hours of Wednesday, April 27th. The event ramped up again during the early afternoon of April 27th continuing into the early evening.  The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 23 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 23, 12 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.||By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi. It did not take long for these storms to take on ���classic��� supercell structures and begin producing tornadoes. The first tornado of the afternoon started in Neshoba County on the north side of Philadelphia. This tornado ended up producing EF-5 damage and tracked for 29 miles across Neshoba, Kemper, Winston and Noxubee Counties. Through the rest of the afteroon multiple tornadoes developed, stemming from multiple supercell storms. Nearly all of the storms produced tornadoes, with many of them long track and significant. The other violent tornado to impact the Jackson, MS forecast area occurred across Smith, Jasper, and Clarke Counties. This tornado continued into Alabama and had a total path length of 124 miles across both states.||Loss of life during this historic event was staggering. Unfortunately, 321 people lost their lives making this the second deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history. The March 18, 1925 Tri-State tornado outbreak is first with 747 fatalities. This marks the first EF-5 tornado in Mississippi since the Candlestick Park tornado on May 3, 1966, and this marks the first time since statistics have been kept that two EF-5 tornadoes have been recorded on the same day in Mississippi, with the tornado in Smithville also rated as EF-5. Incredibly, 4 tornadoes had path lengths over 100 miles across the southern states during this event, and all 4 of these were rated either EF-4 or EF-5.",126

There was major tree damage here, and amazingly, the north end of a concrete bridge was lifted up, causing damage to the concrete sides, guard rails, and asphalt. The tornado then traveled east-northeast causing damage to trees and several homes. One mobile home and two wood frame houses were destroyed on Corinth Road. It then continued east-northeast crossing Highway 80, severely damaging the roofs of two homes and destroying a travel trailer. The tornado dissipated just south of I-20. Maximum wind speeds were estimated at 145 mph.","A historic outbreak of tornadoes across the Ark-La-Miss began late on Tuesday, April 26th continuing into the early morning hours of Wednesday, April 27th. The event ramped up again during the early afternoon of April 27th continuing into the early evening.  The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 23 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 23, 12 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.||By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi. It did not take long for these storms to take on ���classic��� supercell structures and begin producing tornadoes. The first tornado of the afternoon started in Neshoba County on the north side of Philadelphia. This tornado ended up producing EF-5 damage and tracked for 29 miles across Neshoba, Kemper, Winston and Noxubee Counties. Through the rest of the afteroon multiple tornadoes developed, stemming from multiple supercell storms. Nearly all of the storms produced tornadoes, with many of them long track and significant. The other violent tornado to impact the Jackson, MS forecast area occurred across Smith, Jasper, and Clarke Counties. This tornado continued into Alabama and had a total path length of 124 miles across both states.||Loss of life during this historic event was staggering. Unfortunately, 321 people lost their lives making this the second deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history. The March 18, 1925 Tri-State tornado outbreak is first with 747 fatalities. This marks the first EF-5 tornado in Mississippi since the Candlestick Park tornado on May 3, 1966, and this marks the first time since statistics have been kept that two EF-5 tornadoes have been recorded on the same day in Mississippi, with the tornado in Smithville also rated as EF-5. Incredibly, 4 tornadoes had path lengths over 100 miles across the southern states during this event, and all 4 of these were rated either EF-4 or EF-5.",134

A strong maritime-Pacific (mP) cold front accompanied the upper trough through the mid-south into the southeast from the early morning hours of the 27th to the early morning hours of the 28th.  An intense low-level jet with winds in excess of 70 knots was noted in advance of this system and tracked across the mid-south early on the 27th, across north Alabama and north Georgia into the early morning hours of the 28th.  West-southwest winds aloft were highly diffluent and near 200 mph across this same region.  The strong low-level jet brought unseasonably, warm, moist Gulf air northward in advance of the mP cold front.  Dewpoints in the 70s and maximum temperatures in the 80s combined with the extremely strong low-level and upper jets to create an almost perfect environment for severe thunderstorms and large devastating tornadoes.  Indeed, the tornado outbreak that affected much of the eastern U.S., but particularly the south central and southeastern U.S. during this period, was unprecedented and likely the largest recorded in U.S. history.  The tornado outbreak that accompanied this combination of weather features has been termed the 2011 Super Outbreak, an outbreak even worse than the 1994 and 1974 super tornado outbreaks across the eastern U.S.  The outbreak affected the South Central, Southeast, Midwest, and even the usually less tornado prone Northeastern United States.  Over 330 tornadoes were reported during this outbreak which began on April 25th and continued into the 28th affecting 21 states from Texas to New York.  Even isolated tornadoes were noted in Canada.  Nearly 350 people died from these tornadoes, of which over 230 of these were in Alabama alone.  Four tornadoes on April 27th in Alabama and Mississippi were ranked EF5, the highest tornado damage rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  On average, there is only one EF5 tornado per year in the entire U.S.||Widespread and destructive tornadoes occurred on each day of the outbreak, but April 27th was clearly one of the most prolific and destructive tornado days in U.S. history, probably only surpassed by the Tri-State outbreak of 1925 and the Tupelo-Gainesville outbreak of 1936.  The 24-hour period from 8 am April 27th to 8 a.m. April 28th is listed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as the fourth deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history, with the 24 hours commencing April 28th at 8 a.m. as the fifth deadliest tornado day in U.S. history.  It has also been determined to be the costliest tornado outbreaks and one of the costliest natural disasters in the U.S., even after adjustments for inflation, with total damages estimated to exceed $10 billion. ||Georgia was heavily impacted by this tornado outbreak, especially the northwest part of the state which bore the brunt of the massive supercell thunderstorms producing killer tornadoes that tracked east-northeast from northern Alabama during the late evening.  All together, there were 15 tornadoes affecting 28 counties within the Peachtree City, Georgia 96-county warning area (CWA) of North and Central Georgia.  All of these occurred within a 24-hour period commencing at 8 am April 27th.  One of these tornadoes was rated an EF4, the first EF4 tornado in Georgia since the Palm Sunday outbreak in 1994.  In addition, there were also four EF3 tornadoes.  Fifteen tornado-related deaths were observed in north and central Georgia, the most tornado-related deaths within the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area since its inception in 1994.  The previous highest tornado-related death total was 12 on March 20, 1998, when a tornado struck Gainesville, Georgia.||Finally, it should be noted that while the most significant period of severe weather during this outbreak for Georgia was from the afternoon of the 27th through the early morning hours of the 28th, there was an initial round of severe weather across northwest Georgia early on the 27th as a decaying line of severe thunderstorms moved into the region from northeast Alabama.

Hundreds of trees were downed along the interstate and several light poles were folded over. Several buildings along US Hwy 31 sustained significant roof and structural damage. The tornado continued northeast where it crossed CR 124, and lifted just west of AL Hwy 79, 4 miles north of Tarrant. ||This tornado was produced by a supercell thunderstorm that began in Newton county Mississippi at 13:54 pm CST, finally dissipating in Macon county, North Carolina at approximately 21:18 pm CST. This supercell spawned several strong to violent tornadoes along its long path, including another violent EF4 tornado that crossed portions of east Central Alabama.","A powerful storm system crossed the Southeast United States on Wednesday, April 27, 2011, resulting in a large and deadly tornado outbreak.  This epic event broke the record for number of tornadoes in a day for the state of Alabama, becoming the most significant tornado outbreak in the state���s history. ||Central Alabama had two rounds of severe weather that day. During the early morning hours, a Quasi-Linear Convective System quickly moved across the northern half of the National Weather Service, Birmingham county warning area. Straight line winds of 90 mph (78kts) or greater and 11 tornadoes lead to widespread damage and power outages. During the afternoon, long-lived supercell thunderstorms produced long-track, strong and violent tornadoes. Destruction and loss of life across many towns and communities was devastating. ||The hardest hit areas included Shottsville and Hackleburg, both in Marion County, where winds of 160 mph and 210 mph respectively, caused unimagineable damage. Cordova, in Walker County, was hit twice; by a tornado along the Quasi-Linear Convective System during the early morning hours and again in the afternoon by a long-track EF4 tornado. A long track tornado moved across the city of Tuscaloosa and the western suburbs of Birmingham, resulting in the complete destruction of whole neighborhoods and numerous injuries and fatalities in those heavily populated areas. The same parent supercell produced another violent tornado in east Central Alabama as it tracked across St. Clair and Calhoun Counties, resulting in additional fatalities and incredible damage to a number of neighborhoods. Another violent EF4 tornado tracked across portions of Elmore and Tallapoosa Counties, including Lake Martin, destroying numerous homes and a large section of a mobile home park. ||Most of the violent tornadoes from this day were captured on video by a number of people, including storm spotters and chasers, as well as numerous television news crews and remotely controlled web-enabled video cameras.

As the tornado moved northeast along Bailey Road and crossed County Road 130, it intensified and produced high end EF-1 damage, snapping and uprooting trees, taking shingles off roofs, and blowing skirting out from mobile homes. The tornado continued to strengthen as it moved northeast, and along County Roads 136, 107, and 105, it produced damage indicative of high end EF-2. A few mobile homes were destroyed and several homes and buildings sustained significant roof damage, along with extensive tree damage. Along County Road 105, a mobile home was picked up by the tornado, bounced along the ground a couple of times, and was then thrown into woods across the road, with debris scattered for at least a mile downstream, including the frame of the mobile home. The occupant of the mobile home was the first fatality of this tornado. The tornado continued northeast, and reached its most intense and widest point in the Smith County portion of the tornado just before crossing the county line at County Road 103. Here, in the central core of the tornado there was an area of completely mowed down pine trees in which everyone was snapped and many were denuded, and two frame homes had the roofs and exterior walls completely destroyed with extensive damage to interior walls. In addition, many power poles were snapped, a mobile home was annihilated, and a large shop building was completely destroyed. The damage here was rated high end EF-3 with maximum estimated winds of 160 mph.||The tornado remained intense as it crossed into Jasper County and moved across County Road 13, causing very impressive tree damage with nearly every pine tree snapped and extensive evidence of denuding and debarking. Power poles were also snapped. The tornado produced similar type damage as it crossed County Road 16. The tornado then produced its first area of EF-4 damage just northwest of Louin along County Road 164. Here, the tornado struck an area with several mobile homes and one frame home. The frame home was completely destroyed, with most interior walls down and some of the foundation pushed clean. Several mobile homes in the area, including two double wides which the residents said were well strapped down, were completely destroyed with the debris and frames blown great distances. In fact, all of the debris was so dispersed and mixed that it was impossible for the surveyors to reconstruct the positions of the mobile homes and house without explanations from the residents. Two people were killed in a mobile home at this spot; however, several other people abandoned their mobile homes after hearing warnings to shelter in a nearby brick home, and were certainly saved from serious injury or death. ||After crossing Highway 15, the tornado weakened and narrowed somewhat. As it crossed County Road 23, it produced EF-2 damage, destroying two mobile homes and causing extensive tree and powerline damage. The tornado then produced a relatively narrow path of EF-1 tree and powerline damage for several miles, until reintensifying near Rose Hill. As the tornado crossed Highway 18 southeast of Rose Hill, it removed most of the roof of a frame home and caused heavy damage to the exterior walls, took a large section of roof off another frame home, completely destroyed a large tied down mobile home, and caused extensive tree damage. This damage was rated at the low end of EF-3. After causing this damage, the tornado weakened again, causing mainly EF-1 type tree damage until it reached the Clarke County line, with the last point inside the county line on County Road 22 rated as EF-0, with just a few trees and limbs down. ||The tornado then continued into Clarke County and reintensified somewhat, causing tree and powerline damage as it crossed Interstate 59 and US Highway 11. The tornado then became much more intense as it moved along the south side of the town of Enterprise. A number of homes and mobile homes were heavily damaged or destroyed along County Road 320 and State Highway 513. This damage was rated as high EF-2 to low end EF-3. As the tornado passed along a two mile stretch of State Highway 519 east of Enterprise, it heavily damaged several frame homes and caused extensive tree damage. One spot here was the other area of EF-4 damage produced by this tornado. A new construction frame home was completely leveled with the debris swept off the foundation. Residents in the area reported that the house was nearly completed. Based on these reports and the extent of other nearby, primarily tree, damage, this damage is being rated EF-4 with maximum winds of 175 mph. Other damage in this general area was rated as high end EF-2 or low end EF-3. ||The tornado weakened slightly again as it crossed US Highway 45 and State Highway 145, and then caused high end EF-2 and low end EF-3 damage at County Roads 456 and 457. Here, several strapped down double wide mobile homes were destroyed with debris strewn over long distances. Nearby residents reported that one of the mobile homes was occupied by 11 persons at the time of the tornado, and that this was the location where 4 people were killed. Another resident of a nearby mobile home was critically injured. From here, the tornado passed east northeast, just north of the Energy and Snell communities, causing EF-2 damage to a number of frame homes along with extensive tree and powerline damage. The tornado crossed Highway 514 northeast of Snell, still causing extensive tree damage and significant roof damage to several large frame homes, before moving across the state line into Choctaw County, Alabama. The tornado continued into Alabama for 59 miles, bringing the total path length to 124 miles.","A historic outbreak of tornadoes across the Ark-La-Miss began late on Tuesday, April 26th continuing into the early morning hours of Wednesday, April 27th. The event ramped up again during the early afternoon of April 27th continuing into the early evening.  The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 23 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 23, 12 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.||By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi. It did not take long for these storms to take on ���classic��� supercell structures and begin producing tornadoes. The first tornado of the afternoon started in Neshoba County on the north side of Philadelphia. This tornado ended up producing EF-5 damage and tracked for 29 miles across Neshoba, Kemper, Winston and Noxubee Counties. Through the rest of the afteroon multiple tornadoes developed, stemming from multiple supercell storms. Nearly all of the storms produced tornadoes, with many of them long track and significant. The other violent tornado to impact the Jackson, MS forecast area occurred across Smith, Jasper, and Clarke Counties. This tornado continued into Alabama and had a total path length of 124 miles across both states.||Loss of life during this historic event was staggering. Unfortunately, 321 people lost their lives making this the second deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history. The March 18, 1925 Tri-State tornado outbreak is first with 747 fatalities. This marks the first EF-5 tornado in Mississippi since the Candlestick Park tornado on May 3, 1966, and this marks the first time since statistics have been kept that two EF-5 tornadoes have been recorded on the same day in Mississippi, with the tornado in Smithville also rated as EF-5. Incredibly, 4 tornadoes had path lengths over 100 miles across the southern states during this event, and all 4 of these were rated either EF-4 or EF-5.",141

Along this line, the tornado passed through Fyffe, Rainsville, Sylvania, and eventually into northern DeKalb County south of the Cartersville community, killing 25 people. On the first day of surveys, the survey team noticed initial damage in the Lakeview community where the path width was generally around 50 yards.  This initial damage included mostly felled and snapped trees and structural damage to small buildings.  Extensive damage was noted especially in Rainsville and Sylvania where the path width was estimated to over 1/2 mile wide.  Damage in Rainsville included houses that were completely removed from foundations, with debris scattered for about one mile.  Near this location, trees were debarked and a few mobile homes were completely destroyed, with debris strewn for about a mile downstream.||A narrow corridor of intense damage extended from Skaggs Road to Lingerfeldt Road (also known as County Road 180), extending toward County Road 514.  Along Skaggs Road, a stone house was completely obliterated with much of the interior debris strewn well away from the structure.  A supporting large cement stone pillar was ripped completely out of the ground.  Another home along Skaggs Road was also leveled completely to the ground. The NOAA overflight showed significant ground scarring in this area and a walk through the nearby fields showed large pot marks and other sections of disturbed ground. ||Slightly northeast along Lingerfeldt Road, numerous homes were leveled completely to their foundation with vehicles and debris strewn for hundreds of feet.  Overhead photos and follow-up visual confirmation revealed a mangled vehicle tossed well into a ravine and resting up in the remainder of trees.  At  1608 Lingerfeldt Road/County Road 180, a large two story brick home was completely obliterated with several of the supporting anchors ripped of the ground.  A concrete porch was ripped off with pieces strewn up to 150 yards.  A section of the asphalt driveway was pulled up.  In addition, an anchored liberty safe weighing 800 pounds was pulled off its anchorage and thrown into a wooded area 600 feet away.  When found, the safe's door had been ripped open and completely off.  A large pick-up truck at this residence was found mangled in pieces over 250 yards away in the same wooded area.  The residents of the home survived in a nearby storm pit.  Of note, the storm pit was partially exposed by the tornado with dirt being sucked up and pulled away around the opening.  Next door, a mobile home was completely disintegrated.  The residents of the mobile there also survived in a storm pit.  The section of damage from Skaggs Road to Lingerfeldt Road near the intersection with Crow Lane was deemed to be EF-5 intensity.   Severe damage with high end EF-4 damage was noted in a corridor from County Road 515 through a neighborhood along County Road 441.  In the east and south ends of the neighborhood, many one and two story homes were leveled to their foundation with debris scattered some distance.  Several cars were thrown a large distance in this area.  There was evidence of ground scarring as well as some sidewalk pavement pulled up in this location.  However, some of the homes in this area appeared to be pushed off their foundation initially with limited anchorage. ||In the Sylvania community, similar situation occurred with houses completely removed from foundations and debris blown far downstream.  Some of these houses were connected to their foundations with anchor bolts and foundation straps, indicating a stronger construction of the homes. ||Tornado damage continued from the Blake community, intersecting County Road 27, running parallel between State Highway 75 and Interstate 59 through Henager, Ider, to south of Cartersville.  ||In the Blake community, the tornado path width was estimated to be one half to three quarters of a mile.

All exterior and interior walls of several homes were completely destroyed with partial block and mortar foundations remaining.  In one instance, a concrete slab that served as a porch was displaced a few feet and broken in half.  Some hardwood trees in the area were stripped with no stubs of any branches remaining and were partially debarked.  The Mountain View Baptist Church sustained significant damage.  An old, one-story portion of the church dating back to 1902 and constructed of a brick and mortar exterior on wood frame walls was completely destroyed.  A recent two-story addition to the church was constructed in 2004 and consisting of similar building materials was partially destroyed, with most exterior walls and nearly all interior walls fallen.  A concrete block and mortar foundation was all that remained of a hallway adjoining the two buildings.","A powerful storm system roared across the Southeast United States on Wednesday, April 27, 2011. In the wake of this system, hundreds of people were left injured and/or homeless, along with approximately 100 people who lost their lives in the northern Alabama area alone.

The tornado moved through Eoline and caused significant structural damage consistent with an EF3 rating and winds of 145 mph.  Numerous mobile homes and single family homes sustained minor to major damage. A dozen mobile homes and single family homes were destroyed. In addition, the Eoline Fire Dept and another business were destroyed. One fatality occurred in a vehicle near the fire dept. At least 10 other injuries were noted.

This epic event broke the record for number of tornadoes in a day for the state of Alabama, becoming the most significant tornado outbreak in the state���s history. ||Central Alabama had two rounds of severe weather that day. During the early morning hours, a Quasi-Linear Convective System quickly moved across the northern half of the National Weather Service, Birmingham county warning area. Straight line winds of 90 mph (78kts) or greater and 11 tornadoes lead to widespread damage and power outages. During the afternoon, long-lived supercell thunderstorms produced long-track, strong and violent tornadoes. Destruction and loss of life across many towns and communities was devastating. ||The hardest hit areas included Shottsville and Hackleburg, both in Marion County, where winds of 160 mph and 210 mph respectively, caused unimagineable damage. Cordova, in Walker County, was hit twice; by a tornado along the Quasi-Linear Convective System during the early morning hours and again in the afternoon by a long-track EF4 tornado. A long track tornado moved across the city of Tuscaloosa and the western suburbs of Birmingham, resulting in the complete destruction of whole neighborhoods and numerous injuries and fatalities in those heavily populated areas. The same parent supercell produced another violent tornado in east Central Alabama as it tracked across St. Clair and Calhoun Counties, resulting in additional fatalities and incredible damage to a number of neighborhoods. Another violent EF4 tornado tracked across portions of Elmore and Tallapoosa Counties, including Lake Martin, destroying numerous homes and a large section of a mobile home park. ||Most of the violent tornadoes from this day were captured on video by a number of people, including storm spotters and chasers, as well as numerous television news crews and remotely controlled web-enabled video cameras.

As the tornado moved northeast along Bailey Road and crossed County Road 130, it intensified and produced high end EF-1 damage, snapping and uprooting trees, taking shingles off roofs, and blowing skirting out from mobile homes. The tornado continued to strengthen as it moved northeast, and along County Roads 136, 107, and 105, it produced damage indicative of high end EF-2. A few mobile homes were destroyed and several homes and buildings sustained significant roof damage, along with extensive tree damage. Along County Road 105, a mobile home was picked up by the tornado, bounced along the ground a couple of times, and was then thrown into woods across the road, with debris scattered for at least a mile downstream, including the frame of the mobile home. The occupant of the mobile home was the first fatality of this tornado. The tornado continued northeast, and reached its most intense and widest point in the Smith County portion of the tornado just before crossing the county line at County Road 103. Here, in the central core of the tornado there was an area of completely mowed down pine trees in which everyone was snapped and many were denuded, and two frame homes had the roofs and exterior walls completely destroyed with extensive damage to interior walls. In addition, many power poles were snapped, a mobile home was annihilated, and a large shop building was completely destroyed. The damage here was rated high end EF-3 with maximum estimated winds of 160 mph.||The tornado remained intense as it crossed into Jasper County and moved across County Road 13, causing very impressive tree damage with nearly every pine tree snapped and extensive evidence of denuding and debarking. Power poles were also snapped. The tornado produced similar type damage as it crossed County Road 16. The tornado then produced its first area of EF-4 damage just northwest of Louin along County Road 164. Here, the tornado struck an area with several mobile homes and one frame home. The frame home was completely destroyed, with most interior walls down and some of the foundation pushed clean. Several mobile homes in the area, including two double wides which the residents said were well strapped down, were completely destroyed with the debris and frames blown great distances. In fact, all of the debris was so dispersed and mixed that it was impossible for the surveyors to reconstruct the positions of the mobile homes and house without explanations from the residents. Two people were killed in a mobile home at this spot; however, several other people abandoned their mobile homes after hearing warnings to shelter in a nearby brick home, and were certainly saved from serious injury or death. ||After crossing Highway 15, the tornado weakened and narrowed somewhat. As it crossed County Road 23, it produced EF-2 damage, destroying two mobile homes and causing extensive tree and powerline damage. The tornado then produced a relatively narrow path of EF-1 tree and powerline damage for several miles, until reintensifying near Rose Hill. As the tornado crossed Highway 18 southeast of Rose Hill, it removed most of the roof of a frame home and caused heavy damage to the exterior walls, took a large section of roof off another frame home, completely destroyed a large tied down mobile home, and caused extensive tree damage. This damage was rated at the low end of EF-3. After causing this damage, the tornado weakened again, causing mainly EF-1 type tree damage until it reached the Clarke County line, with the last point inside the county line on County Road 22 rated as EF-0, with just a few trees and limbs down. ||The tornado then continued into Clarke County and reintensified somewhat, causing tree and powerline damage as it crossed Interstate 59 and US Highway 11. The tornado then became much more intense as it moved along the south side of the town of Enterprise. A number of homes and mobile homes were heavily damaged or destroyed along County Road 320 and State Highway 513. This damage was rated as high EF-2 to low end EF-3. As the tornado passed along a two mile stretch of State Highway 519 east of Enterprise, it heavily damaged several frame homes and caused extensive tree damage. One spot here was the other area of EF-4 damage produced by this tornado. A new construction frame home was completely leveled with the debris swept off the foundation. Residents in the area reported that the house was nearly completed. Based on these reports and the extent of other nearby, primarily tree, damage, this damage is being rated EF-4 with maximum winds of 175 mph. Other damage in this general area was rated as high end EF-2 or low end EF-3. ||The tornado weakened slightly again as it crossed US Highway 45 and State Highway 145, and then caused high end EF-2 and low end EF-3 damage at County Roads 456 and 457. Here, several strapped down double wide mobile homes were destroyed with debris strewn over long distances. Nearby residents reported that one of the mobile homes was occupied by 11 persons at the time of the tornado, and that this was the location where 4 people were killed. Another resident of a nearby mobile home was critically injured. From here, the tornado passed east northeast, just north of the Energy and Snell communities, causing EF-2 damage to a number of frame homes along with extensive tree and powerline damage. The tornado crossed Highway 514 northeast of Snell, still causing extensive tree damage and significant roof damage to several large frame homes, before moving across the state line into Choctaw County, Alabama. The tornado continued into Alabama for 59 miles, bringing the total path length to 124 miles.","A historic outbreak of tornadoes across the Ark-La-Miss began late on Tuesday, April 26th continuing into the early morning hours of Wednesday, April 27th. The event ramped up again during the early afternoon of April 27th continuing into the early evening.  The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 23 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 23, 12 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.||By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi. It did not take long for these storms to take on ���classic��� supercell structures and begin producing tornadoes. The first tornado of the afternoon started in Neshoba County on the north side of Philadelphia. This tornado ended up producing EF-5 damage and tracked for 29 miles across Neshoba, Kemper, Winston and Noxubee Counties. Through the rest of the afteroon multiple tornadoes developed, stemming from multiple supercell storms. Nearly all of the storms produced tornadoes, with many of them long track and significant. The other violent tornado to impact the Jackson, MS forecast area occurred across Smith, Jasper, and Clarke Counties. This tornado continued into Alabama and had a total path length of 124 miles across both states.||Loss of life during this historic event was staggering. Unfortunately, 321 people lost their lives making this the second deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history. The March 18, 1925 Tri-State tornado outbreak is first with 747 fatalities. This marks the first EF-5 tornado in Mississippi since the Candlestick Park tornado on May 3, 1966, and this marks the first time since statistics have been kept that two EF-5 tornadoes have been recorded on the same day in Mississippi, with the tornado in Smithville also rated as EF-5. Incredibly, 4 tornadoes had path lengths over 100 miles across the southern states during this event, and all 4 of these were rated either EF-4 or EF-5.",147

Numerous retailers including Home Depot, Sports Academy, Dillons, and Walmart were also destroyed.  The most substantial building impacted was St John's hospital which will be razed due to the tornado.  It was calculated that 2 million cubic yards of debris is attributable to the storm across its relatively short length on the ground.||The tornado initially touched down one half mile southwest of the intersection of JJ Highway and Newton Road in Newton County where several large trees were toppled. ||The tornado rapidly intensified as it moved toward the intersection of Country Club Drive and 32nd Street where it crossed into Jasper County. Damage became more widespread as the tornado crossed Maiden Lane, breaking nearly all windows on three sides of St. Johns Hospital as well as damage to the roof and exterior walls on several floors.  Two patients on oxygen were indirectly suffocated when the generator and a backup generator were damaged after power was cut off.  Three additional patients may have succumbed similarly though sufficient data as to the cause of death was not available.  An additional indirect fatality occurred due to psychological trauma.||The tornado further intensified as it destroyed homes and businesses to the immediate east and north of the hospital. A church school was completely destroyed with the exception of a portion of the sanctuary.  Significant damage to the Greenbriar Nursing Home resulted in the death of 20 mostly elderly patients.  ||The tornado continued to destroy hundreds of frame homes between 32nd and 20th Streets, leading to nearly a fifth of the deaths. Three story apartment complexes had the top two floors removed; other two story complexes were partially leveled. Fourteen deaths occurred in apartments along the track.  Eleven additional deaths occurred in churches along this path.  There were two fatalities in a mobile home (Joplin has a city ordinance prohibiting mobile home parks). ||Well built structures that were heavily damaged or destroyed along this area included the Joplin High School, Franklin Technical Center and Irving Elementary, all of which were free of students due to the weekend.  The tornado also damaged three additional elementary schools.  A bank was totally destroyed with the exception of the vault. A large grocery store was also destroyed.  ||The tornado crossed Rangeline Road near 20th Street. Damage included significant to complete damage to several restaurants and large long-span retail buildings; including Home Depot, Sports Academy and Walmart in this area.  Twenty deaths occurred indoors or in the parking lots of these structures.  Semi trucks on the back side of Walmart were thrown more than a quarter mile.||The tornado continued to move eastward along and south of 20th Street destroying numerous warehouse style facilities, a portion of Joplin East Middle School, and residences through Duquesne Road.||The tornado continued destroying numerous homes as it began weakening. It turned southeast toward Interstate 44 where it threw several semi trucks as it crossed the interstate and moved into Newton County at 32nd Street just west of Kodiak Road.","A strong upper level trough across the central plains region and a strong upper level disturbance along with a frontal boundary in the area produced numerous severe storms with a few supercells across southeast Kansas. One cyclic supercell associated with the system produced a very large and deadly EF-5 tornado that hit the city of Joplin and then spawned two separate tornadoes that moved across southwestern Missouri. A separate tornadic supercell produced an EF-3 tornado that moved into McDonald County from Northeastern Oklahoma. ||Continuing thunderstorms lasted into May 23 as another line of thunderstorms moved across the region. This line of storms produced reports of large hail, damaging winds and a weak EF-0 tornado in south central Missouri. As the storms moved over the Joplin area, two police officers were struck by lightning while aiding in the post tornado efforts.

Well-built homes were destroyed, with some cleaned off of their foundation. A concrete dome home was severely damage, mainly by the flying debris. Trees were debarked or destroyed. Very little was left standing for the first few miles into McClain county. Fairly consistent EF-3, with brief periods of EF-4 damage occurred as the tornado neared/crossed Highway 9, near the Highway 76 junction. The tornado began to weaken as it moved toward the Cleveland county border, with mainly trees and power poles/lines snapped. The tornado continued into Cleveland County. Monetary damage estimates were not available.","A tornado outbreak occurred over parts of northern and central Oklahoma during the day on the 24th, with violent tornadoes devastating several communities. By the end of the day, one EF-5, two EF-4, and two EF-3 tornadoes destroyed buildings, ripped up trees and power poles, and unfortunately, resulted in 11 deaths. The day began with a strong upper level trough ejecting out of the southwest United States. The trough took on a negative tilt as it approached the southern Plains. A strong jet stream was located at both the middle and upper levels rotating around the upper trough. At the surface, a low pressure strengthened rapidly over northwest Oklahoma, keeping the low-level flow of warm, moist air to flow east of a dry line that had moved into western Oklahoma. Thunderstorms developed by early afternoon over western Oklahoma, and quickly became supercellular as they moved northeast. Strong low-level rotation developed early, with the first tornado occurring over Blaine county, and moved northeast into Major county. Another supercell rapidly gained low-level rotation as it moved from Caddo into Canadian County. This tornado became the strongest of them all as it moved north of El Reno, west of Piedmont, and to south of Guthrie in Logan county. Nine people died as a result of this tornado. Two more powerful supercells developed over Grady county, and they moved northeast into McClain and Cleveland counties. Finally, the final tornado occurred east of Norman into Pottawatomie county. The timing of this outbreak could not have come at a worse time, as rush hour was just unfolding as the tornadoes neared the Oklahoma City metro area.",185

The final tornado breakdown per the EF Scale included two EF3, four EF2, two EF1 and three EF0. Despite considerable damage to mainly rural residences, these tornadoes resulted in no fatalities and only one known non-life threatening injury when a semi truck was tipped over near Elm Creek in Buffalo County. This Elm Creek tornado was also the only one to directly strike a community, although there were several close calls within a mile or two of places such as Amherst, Hampton and Bradshaw. Interestingly, tornadic storms also spared the immediate Tri-Cities population centers of Grand Island, Hastings and Kearney, despite damaging events occurring nearby to both the west and the east. This was largely due to the fact that an expansive mid-level dry intrusion became anchored over central sections of South Central Nebraska, protecting this area from storm development. In addition to tornadoes, the afternoon also featured several reports of large hail up to baseball size, and damaging winds up to 80 MPH. ||This outbreak focused between 3 and 8 PM CDT, as a seasonably powerful mid-level low pressure system lifted into western Kansas and Nebraska out of Colorado, deepening and closing off as it did so. Strong wind fields aloft were in place at all levels, with a 50-70 knot jet streak nosing into the region between the 500 and 300 millibar level, and an 850-millibar low-level jet accelerating to between 30 and 40 knots. At the surface, a well-defined 992-millibar low pressure center migrated from north central Kansas around the noon hour, to near Hastings by early evening. A synoptically classic array of surface boundaries evolved around this low pressure center, with a warm front lifting north across South Central Nebraska, while a cold front and dryline pushed in from the west and southwest. In addition, a well-defined inverted surface trough axis extended nearly due north from the surface low into north central Nebraska. The net combination synoptic and mesoscale features yielded a very favorable setup for tornadic supercells across the area. At mid-afternoon, shear and instability parameters included approximately 50 knots of deep-layer vertical wind shear, 15-25 knots of 0-1 kilometer low-level vertical wind shear, 150 to over 300 m2/s2 of surface to 1 kilometer storm-relative helicity and 2000-4000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE. ||In general, there were two distinct corridors of tornadic storms across the area, one focused west of Highway 281, and one mainly east of Highway 281 and along and north of Interstate 80. The first tornadic storm of the day entered southwestern Harlan County around 3 PM CDT, having produced several damaging tornadoes across northwest and north central Kansas since early afternoon. This storm spawned an EF1 tornado in the Stamford area, before weakening. Within minutes however, a newly developed tornadic storm started tracking north from Phelps County into southwestern Buffalo County. Between 330 and 445 PM CDT, this storm dropped several tornadoes from near Elm Creek, to north of Amherst, including the first EF3 of the day. This EF3 near Amherst intensified to at least 3/4 of a mile wide, and significantly damaged or destroyed at least 10 homes. A veteran storm chaser described this tornado as being one of the strongest he had ever witnessed as it tracked north of Amherst. An additional tornadic storm that initiated in Buffalo County, along with subsequent storm-scale interactions from further development, moved north and produced several more tornadoes between 430 and 545 PM CDT, including an EF2 southwest of Rockville, and an EF1 that struck the Davis Creek Reservoir campground south of North Loup. ||While tornadoes were ongoing across western portions of the area, vigorous new supercell development took place in eastern portions of South Central Nebraska around 430 PM CDT, just east of the surface triple-point. Two storms in close proximity to one another both became tornadic around 530 PM CDT near the Hamilton and York County line. The first produced an EF2 that crossed Interstate 80 southwest of Hampton. As this tornado moved north of Hampton, two farm workers fashioned a narrow escape by sprinting nearly 100 yards to an underground windmill pit and jumping inside as the tornado passed overhead. Just to the east, the other storm also dropped an EF2 tornado, which also happened to be the longest continuous tornado track of the day, traveling 15 miles from southwest of Bradshaw to near the York-Polk County line. Within a few minutes of this tornado's demise, the cyclic supercell quickly put down the second EF3 tornado of the day, tracking over 9 miles from east of Polk to west-northwest of Osceola. This tornado grew to around 1/2-mile wide, and damaged several farms along the way, with some of the most significant damage along Highway 92. After this tornado dissipated around 620 PM CDT, the parent supercell and other severe storms farther west finally lifted north out of South Central Nebraska. Although this ended the main severe weather event for the evening, a few additional strong to severe storms affected primarily Fillmore and Furnas Counties between 630 and 830 PM CDT. ||Taking a backseat to significant tornadoes on this day were hail and heavy rainfall. Some of the largest reported hailstones included baseball size in Buffalo County, and tennis ball size in York County. Rainfall-wise, although there were no widespread flooding impacts, localized rural flooding occurred as many locations received 1-3 inches in a rather short time. Some northwestern portions of South Central Nebraska, including parts of Valley, Greeley and Sherman Counties measured 48-hour rainfall totals into the 3-4 inch range.",198

Damage was noted right at the start of the path, with a brick home on Highway 66 west of Polk suffering significant roof, window and tree damage, and a semi-truck and trailer were knocked over onto its side.  About 2 miles north of Highway 66, a residence suffered minor tree damage and lost an outbuilding, and a combine was tossed about 100 yards into a field.  As the tornado continued north, numerous power poles were snapped, irrigation pivots were overturned, and crops were stripped from the ground. The most significant damage occurred when a farmstead on Highway 92 approximately 6 miles west of Osceola took a direct hit.  The home as well as surrounding outbuildings and trees were either destroyed or suffered significant damage.  A car, tractor, and an ATV were thrown from their original locations into the field just north of the home.  The tornado finally lifted approximately 2 miles north of the intersection of Highways 92 and 39, but not before striking another farmstead, destroying an outbuilding and garage, and damaging a machine shed and barn.

Damage was observed all along the tornado path, with no fewer than five farmsteads impacted, some very severely. One injury occurred where a farm home was damaged beyond repair. There were no deaths. The worst damage consisted of a farm house completely destroyed, outbuildings completely destroyed, a vehicle tossed up to one half mile away from its original location and almost unrecognizable as a motor vehicle, and a significant number of very large hard and soft wood trees both snapped and uprooted. The violent nature of tornadoes was evidenced by the twisted and mangled trees. In one case farm animals were killed. The tornado damage corresponded to EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. From that it was determined that wind speeds were on the order of 165 miles per hour.","A prolonged severe weather event materialized July 17th with an extremely unstable atmosphere present and supportive mid level dynamics. The first wave of storms occurred from the mid morning through the early afternoon hours as a short wave mid level impulse crested the central plains upper ridge across North Dakota.

The storms came in two waves.  The first began during the mid-morning hours when two tornadic supercells developed across north central Alabama.  The tornadoes (one EF-3 and one EF-2) tracked rapidly east-northeast across northeast Limestone and northern Madison Counties.  ||During the early afternoon, numerous thunderstorms re-erupted across north Alabama, including several supercells.  Most of these storms were large hail producers, in one case up to softball sized.  Three additional weak tornadoes were spawned in Limestone County.  There were also reports of isolated wind damage.  One last band of storms rolled through parts of north central and northeast Alabama during the mid evening hours as the cold front moved through.",208

This tornado was the strongest of the day in the southeastern U.S.--rated a strong EF3 with 165 MPH maximum winds.  The tornado formed on a northward-extending peninsula in Lake Chickamauga, just north of the Booker T. Washington State Park. At this point, the tornado downed a few trees and caused some light structural damage. ||The tornado then moved ENE and crossed Waconga Bay.  On the east side of the bay the tornado smashed a very large marina--Island Cove Marina--causing $6,000,000 in damage.  The tornado was a strong EF1 with about 110 mph winds.  The tornado track so far was about 2 miles long.||The tornado continued to strengthen as it went on land, crossed State Highway 58 and quickly strengthed to EF2.  Over the next two miles the path was a consistent EF2 to EF3 through several neighborhoods.  The worst damage was found along Short Tail Springs Road, Woodland Bay Drive and Davis Mill Circle.  The most intense damage was found near the intersection of Short Tail Springs Road and Woodland Bay Drive where many residences suffered EF3 damage with one residence wiped out.  Across, to the south of Short Tail Springs Road, an entire forest of trees was downed.  ||By the time the tornado left this neighborhood it was mainly EF2, went across another couple of inlets of the lake, and emerged as an EF1 by the time it crossed Ooltewah-Georgetown Rd, (CR 1145).  From here to the Bradley County line, the tornado continued to the ENE through rural areas oscillating between EF1 and low-end EF2 damage.  The tornado continued into and across Bradley, northern Polk County, and into southern McMinn County.  The total pathlength was 41 miles.||In Hamilton County, there were 30 injuries, including 6 serious injuries, but no fatalities. There were 80+ homes destroyed, 85+ homes with major damage with a total of 260+ with damage to about $20 Million.  Damage to public infrastructure totaled $2.1 Million.  Initial overall estimates exceeded $28 Million.||A Presidential Disaster was declared for this area.  EMA officials were amazed there were no deaths after seeing the intensity at some locations.||Note: The tornado had two turns in Hamilton County--a slight left turn at 35.1367/-85.1121 and another slight left turn (even farther left) at 35.1585/-85.0352.","A deepening low pressure system moved northeast from the Mid Mississippi Valley through the Great Lakes initially driving a warm front northward through the Southern Appalachian region during the afternoon. The associated cold front swept across the area late Friday night. A one hundred knot upper level jet positioned over a 50 knot low level jet resulted in a strongly sheared environment. The intense shear and moderate instability produced an atmosphere conducive to long-lived, discrete, supercell thunderstorms. A total of 9 tornadoes ranging in intensity from EF-0 to EF-3 produced widespread damage and nearly 50 injuries to East Tennessee residents in the path of the storms.",209

Damage at that location was consistent with 130 mph winds.  ||High tension wires were downed and trees snapped along West End Road just north of Shanks Hill Road.  The tornado continued to intensify as it crossed State Route 135 at Dutch Creek Road, ripping large chunks of 3 inch thick asphalt from a section of roadway and depositing large pieces up to 30 yards away, with smaller chunks of pavement found a quarter of a mile downstream.  Just east of State Route 135, tremendous tree damage began. At this point, the tornado widened to around 200 yards. As the tornado crossed Trainer Lane and Route 335 towards Robbs Lane, widespread tree and structural damage indicated EF-2 to EF-3 damage. At this point, the damage path began to widen to one third of a mile. ||After crossing Highway 60 just south of New Pekin, tremendous structural damage was surveyed. A large well-constructed factory building was cleared to its foundation slab with numerous anchoring bolts bent and stripped. Debris from this building was observed up to three quarters of a mile downstream. Large power poles were snapped. Another metal out building on the edge of the circulation had sheeting pulled off, apparently from the force of inbound winds towards the circulation. In this area 5 people were killed in a mobile home. Damage suggested an EF-4 tornado with a width of three to four tenths of a mile and estimated winds of 170 mph. ||The tornado then traveled along the border between Washington and Crawford counties where it caused widespread destruction southeast of Hurst and along East Daisy Hill Road in the county.  Here, a well constructed one story brick home at the top of a ridge was completely destroyed with no wall left standing. Witnesses described the funnel as a black wall. A heavy semi trailer cab was blown from this house and landed near another destroyed brick home. Damage to these homes suggested EF-4 winds of 170 mph. Near the intersection of East Daisy Hill and Williams Knob Roads, a home and two anchored double wide trailers were destroyed. A car was lifted and fell 100 yards away from its original driveway. The width of the damage path along the county line was up to one half mile, although the concentrated damage path was much more narrow. Overall, the twister traveled 17 miles in Washington county, felling thousands of trees in addition to destroying scores of buildings.","A surface Low over Missouri early in the afternoon of March 2nd strengthened to below 990mb as it moved north into Michigan by the evening hours.

The tornado moved southeast and produced EF-1 damage with winds estimated at 100 mph. Damage was limited to uprooted and snapped trees as well as minor roof damage. The tornado strengthened as it hit the Horseshoe Bend Subdivision with winds estimated at 120 mph and structural damage to the outside of homes. The tornado then continued to track southeast alongside Dexter-Pinckney Rd. and produced EF-3 damage at 5:31pm. Winds estimated at 135-140 mph destroyed one home northwest of Dexter. The tornado then made a left turn and paralleled Huron River Dr. producing EF-2 damage on the north side of Dexter. The tornado then produced EF-3 damage again at 5:49pm in the Huron Farms Subdivision with winds estimated at 135-140 mph. One home was destroyed and another house had only interior rooms left standing. The tornado then weakened as it moved southeast and lifted at 5:56 pm near the intersection of Zeeb Rd. and Ann Arbor-Dexter Rd. In total, 20 homes were severely damaged, with some damage to at least 200 homes.","An amplified, upper level weather pattern allowed for an unseasonably warm and humid air mass to infiltrate the southern Great Lakes region.  Highly anomalous for the month of March, surface dew points climbed into the lower 60 degree range across much of Southeastern Michigan. This rich moisture combined with an upper level disturbance tracking northward through Lower Michigan to fuel a long duration severe thunderstorm event across Southeastern Michigan.

The tornado began near the intersection of Broad St and N Bois D'arc Street just southwest of Highway 80. As it moved to the northeast, the first significant damage was noted near Aimee St and N Bois D'arc St. There was substantial tree damage with some large trees uprooted near this intersection. Also, shingle damage, roof damage to a fire station nearby, blown out windows at a few homes and an outbuilding was destroyed, all near this intersection.  A street sign at the intersection was also completely bent flat near the base. The tornado moved northeast and crossed Hwy 80 near the Forney Cleaners business where substantial roof and commercial sign damage occurred.  Debris was also observed in the median between the east and westbound lanes near this location. The tornado continued northeast producing light damage to industrial buildings, but was largely over open fields. The tornado then crossed over Ridgecrest Rd and produced substantial damage to many homes in the Diamond Creek subdivision. One of the first homes struck was on Woodberry Dr and was completely destroyed.  Several more homes were destroyed in this subdivision and other homes sustained substantial damage. It was determined that several of the destroyed homes were destroyed as the result of excessive lift being forced upon the roof, and the roofs of these homes were poorly attached to the external walls of the home. Once the roofs failed, pressure built up on internal walls causing the failure of nearly all external and internal walls. As the tornado continued northeast through the subdivision it consistently produced damage to homes, most of which was different degrees of roof or top floor damage. The tornado exited the subdivision at Crosby Elementary School. The tornado damaged several vehicles that were in the school���s parking lot. One vehicle was lofted approximately 300 yards into a field northeast of the school. The school itself sustained mainly roof damage.  Children were in the school when the tornado struck, but no injuries occurred.  The tornado continued northeast for several miles, producing light/EF-0 damage along the way. In total, this tornado destroyed 14 homes, caused major damage to 28 homes and minor damage to another 42 homes. Many of the damaged homes were in the Diamond Creek Subdivision. Due to damage in the Diamond Creek Subdivision, the maximum estimated winds with this tornado were 170 mph. The path length was approximately 7.7 miles, and the maximum width was 150 yards. Seven people sustained non life-threatening injuries.","A historic North Texas tornado outbreak occurred on April 3rd, with 17 tornadoes developing from the DFW Metroplex east to Hopkins County. An EF-3 tornado tore through the town of Forney, heavily damaging homes in the Diamond Creek subdivision. Three EF-2 tornadoes damaged parts of Arlington and Kennedale in Tarrant County; Red Oak, Lancaster, and Dallas in Ellis and Dallas counties; and Royse City in Rockwall and Hunt counties. An EF-1 tornado caused damage near Joshua in Johnson County, and the remaining 12 tornadoes were rated EF-0s. In addition to the tornadoes, large hail damaged many parts of the DFW Metroplex. Approximately 110 airplanes at DFW International Airport were damaged by the hail and taken out of service until repaired. No fatalities occurred and only 29 people were injured. Of the 29 injuries, only 3 were considered serious but everyone made a full recovery.  The environmental set-up on this day consisted of a cut-off low over New Mexico with a front draped north-to-south across the western counties of the CWA. By mid to late morning, strong and severe storms developed along the front as a lobe of energy rotated into west Texas and forcing from this energy overspread the front. The atmosphere was already unstable and uncapped by this time. In addition, a Mesoscale Convective System in Oklahoma sent an outflow boundary south across the Red River. This outflow boundary moved south of the DFW Metroplex by the late morning hours, and isolated storms began to develop south of the outflow boundary but east of the front. As these storms moved north and crossed the outflow boundary, the low level rotation increased and the storms quickly became tornadic. All of the tornadic storms were tied to this outflow boundary as it retreated north as a warm front.",233

Additional tree damage occurred as the tornado tracked eastward nearly paralleling Braddock Road before lifting near Beaver Dam Road.","A vigorous, fast-moving, early autumn storm system brought severe weather to portions of the ArkLaMiss region from the evening of October 17th, 2012 into the early morning hours of October 18th. The combination of intense wind shear, strong winds and adequate moisture and instability resulted in severe storms developing along and ahead of a strong cold front as it raced across the forecast area. Numerous reports of wind damage from supercell and bowing-type thunderstorms were received as the storms produced strong straight line winds and tornadoes from the Delta region, southeast into Central Mississippi, and reaching into parts of east central and southeast Mississippi. There were sporadic reports of hail, but with such fierce wind shear over the region, straight line winds and tornadoes were the primary modes of severe weather during this event.||To put some historical perspective on this rare early Fall severe weather event, the EF-3 that occurred across Scott and Newton counties was only the second F3 to occur in the month of October in Mississippi in recorded history. The three strong tornadoes for this event is second all time to the Oct 17, 1980 event where 7 tornadoes occurred (6 of which were strong (F2)). Additionally, there were eleven total tornadoes during this event which ties October 13, 2001 for the most tornadoes during any October event.",246

The tornado continued to expand in size just southwest of the El Reno Municipal Air Park, where its speed increased to 30 to 40 mph.  As the tornado passed just south of the airport, two satellite tornadoes formed briefly on the west side of the tornado.||At 6:19 p.m. the tornado crossed Highway 81 near Reno Road as it continued to expand in size.  There, the tornado abruptly turned to the north, while also accelerating to greater than 50 mph.

Additionally, several other people were killed while attempting to escape the tornado near Highway 81.  Finally, two people were killed along I-40 while waiting for the storm to pass.||The monetary damages were estimated.  This tornado was well sampled by two separate mobile research radar teams ��� the University of Oklahoma RaXPol radar, and the Center for Severe Weather Research���s Doppler on Wheels. Both radars captured high temporal and spatial resolution data relatively close to the large tornado. Both radars measured winds in the tornado of more than 200 mph. The RaXPol radar data shows winds of at least 295 mph very close to the surface. These intense winds were present in very small sub-vortices within the larger tornado circulation. An analysis of the high resolution radar data combined with the results of the ground damage survey indicates that none of these intense sub-vortices impacted any structures in rural Canadian County. So despite the measured wind speeds, surveyors could not find any damage that would support a rating higher than EF3 based solely on the damage indicators used with the EF scale. ||The maximum tornado width was 2.6 miles.  However, the damaging wind swath was much larger, as non-tornadic downdraft winds extended for at least a mile south of the tornado.  Given the difficulty of separating this damage from tornadic damage, the OU RaXPol radar was used to help determine the width.","A tornado outbreak occurred during the late afternoon and early evening hours of the 31st.

These storms traveled eastward, eventually impacting the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. Several tornadoes occurred, including the El Reno tornado, which unfortunately claimed several lives. In addition to the tornado, very large hail and heavy rains led to flash flooding in Oklahoma City.

CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was in the 600 to 800 J/kg range.  The freezing level was quite high, at 15,200 feet, limiting the hail potential through much of the event.  During the evening, as the surface low pressure moved to the east of the area.  Temperatures aloft fell rapidly and the character of the storms changed from supercellular to short line segments.  They began producing hail with the largest in Bremer County east of Readlyn with golf ball to baseball size hail.  The LCL was low, around 750 meters, making for a favorable environment for tornadic development.  Seven tornadoes occurred during the afternoon hours in Wright and Franklin counties with the strongest tornado rating of EF3. Flooding occurred in north central Iowa in parts of Cerro Gordo and Worth County.  Rainfall of 2 to 3 inches in under an hour occurred, resulting in flash flooding initially, then general flooding overnight.  Numerous roads were flooded and closed.  Rescue operations took place in Worth County as motorists were stranded by the rising water.  The motorist hydroplaned off of a highway into a ditch full of water.  After the rain ended, flooding continued through the night as standing water took several hours to recede.",270

The tornado produced mainly tree damage as it moved northeast across Lincoln Road, but tore off portions of the roofs of houses along Smith Mill Road. It continued moving northeast and intensified near the intersection of Old Lincoln Road and Tipton Lane where it produced its most significant damage. Three houses were almost completely destroyed, leaving only a few interior walls standing. This is also the area where two fatalities occurred, as their mobile home was flipped and destroyed, with its frame having been thrown approximately 125 yards across the street. At another nearby house along Smith Mill Road, even interior walls were collapsed and pushed (though left partially intact). The cars In the attached garage were pushed 10 to 15 feet. A nearby barn was completely destroyed and a nearby RV was rolled approximately 10 yards. The tornado tore off much of the roof from South Lincoln Elementary school, dragged a school bus approximately 75 yards, and caused it to impact the front wall of the school. Additional damage was incurred to homes just northeast of the school, where large sections of roofing were removed. Some of the most widespread damage occurred along Price Lane where multiple mobile homes were rolled as much as 50 yards and completely destroyed. Single family homes had exterior walls collapsed and roofs removed with electrical transmission towers completely toppled. The tornado continued to produce tree and roof damage as it moved northeast across Corders Crossroads and Crystal Springs Roads. Houses were pushed off their foundations near the intersection of Howell Mill Road and Crystal Springs Road, and nearby truss electrical transmission towers were crumpled.||The tornado appeared to weaken somewhat northeast of this location as it continued to snap multiple trees and produce minor roof damage. It broadened upon crossing Highway 64 and moved along Smithland Road where it snapped hundreds more trees and a few power poles. The tornado crossed the Elk river, toppled more trees, and produced minor roof damage in the Champ community.","A tornado outbreak occurred during the late afternoon and evening across the central Tennessee Valley on the 28th. Several cyclic supercells produced tornadoes, some of which were strong. There were also reports of flash flooding, especially in urban areas of Lincoln and Franklin counties, where up to 5 inches fell within two hours.",295

Numerous hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted in this area. The tornado continued to move north with significant damage to a one story home along CR 601. Major roof uplift was noted to this home and a building under construction at the same site was completely destroyed and blown several hundred yards. A large travel trailer was also rolled. Damage at this location was deemed EF-2 in intensity. Further north along the road a large outbuilding was completely destroyed.||The tornado intensified as it moved northward crossing the Broglen River. Here the tornado widens to near 350 yards. Many hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted along the path. A chicken farm sustained damage along CR 732. Near this location along CR 736 a well constructed two story brick home sustained severe damage when the upstairs was completely wiped away and blown several hundred yards into a ravine. Large debris missiles were seen embedded in the surrounding fields. Several trees in this area were also severely mangled and partially debarked. Damage in this area was rated low end EF-3.||The tornado continued to track northward ripping the roof completely off a home at the intersection of CR 736 and 703. The tornado intensity oscillated as it tracked northward toward the Berlin community. Numerous wooden power poles were snapped along CR 703. Numerous trees were snapped or uprooted as it crossed Highway 278 with some trees sheared near the base.||A TVA substation suffered significant damage with large electrical lines damaged and poles snapped and destroyed. The survey team was not able to fully observe this damage due to security restrictions but online photos indicate that this particular damage is consistent with at least high end EF-2 or possibly EF-3 damage. A chicken farm sustained severe structural damage with one house completely wiped to the ground with the metal trusses severely mangled. 25,000 chickens were killed in this one location. A mobile home along CR 747 was completely destroyed with debris thrown over 50 yards. Additional tree damage was noted in this area. The tornado weakened quite rapidly after this point lifting just north of Hwy 69.","A tornado outbreak occurred during the late afternoon and evening across the central Tennessee Valley on the 28th.

The tornado crossed the interstate and moved northeast into areas along Dogwood Trail and Magnolia Roads, snapping hundreds of trees and heavily damaging a number of houses and mobile homes. The tornado then turned more to the east, continuing to cause heavy tree damage and destroying a mobile home. As the tornado moved near the intersection of Pleasant Grove and Davenport Road, it reached its maximum intensity in Jones County. It destroyed a wood frame home, leaving only some interior walls standing, and destroyed hundreds of trees, including leaving some denuded and partially debarked. After this point, the tornado weakened somewhat, crossed Dallas-Brownlee Road, and then moved into Wayne County. Total path length was almost 11 miles. Maximum winds were around 145 mph.","A powerful spring storm system brought a multi-day severe weather outbreak across a large portion of the country during the April 27-30 time frame. This outbreak started across the Central Plains on the 27th and slowly migrated eastward over the following two days. A large tornado outbreak occurred across the Lower MS River & TN River Valleys on the 28th. The event was capped on the 30th with additional severe weather and a historic flash flooding/heavy rain event along the AL, FL gulf coast where rainfall totals peaked between 15-25 inches!||Across the NWS Jackson, MS forecast area, the tornado outbreak on the 28th was the main event. This event was driven by a classic severe weather pattern with a strong fast moving jet stream and a deep surface cyclone over the central plains. These features helped to produce strong wind shear in the atmosphere which in turn combined with rich gulf moisture and setup a volatile atmospheric mix. Multiple supercell thunderstorms developed during the afternoon/evening and produced many instances of damaging wind and large hail along with multiple tornadoes. The most devastating tornado was the EF-4 which tore a path across NE Leake, the corners of Attala/Neshoba counties, and through the heart of Winston County where the city of Louisville was especially hard hit. This tornado was on ground for 34.3 miles and resulted in 10 fatalities and many injuries. Other hard hit counties were Lowndes, Rankin, Hinds, Scott, Newton, Montgomery, Warren and Jones.

The tornado rapidly intensified as it tracked northeast. Severe damage occurred along Liberty Hill Road where a home was lifted off its block foundation and moved about 60-80 feet from its original location. Despite this, most of the exterior walls (and even a portion of the roof) remained intact. Numerous trees around this property were snapped near the base indicating very strong winds. Several manufactured homes were completely destroyed in this area as well. Two other homes sustained significant roof loss and exterior wall damage. Along Horton Gap Road, a two-story home was destroyed with just a few interior walls left standing. Much of the debris was thrown several hundred yards away from its original location and trees were ripped out of the ground and thrown. Just northeast of this location, a large wood-framed chicken house was destroyed. At these locations, the tornado was at its peak intensity with winds estimated between 135 and 155 mph. On either side of the center line track, damage was seen along Owens Road (west of the track) and Roden Road (east of the track), as a result of inflow into the storm. Structural damage along these roads resulted in loss of roof and exterior walls/side panels as well as numerous trees snapped or uprooted. The tornado crossed into Dekalb County near the intersection of Gene Burns Rd and County Road 4.","A large scale severe weather event began Saturday, April 26 and ended Wednesday, April 30th, producing several waves of severe weather from the Central Plains eastward through the Deep South, and across a significant portion of the eastern United States.

It was one of the strongest tornado of the day in south central Nebraska, rated an EF3 with the peak wind estimated to be 150 MPH. Rear flank downdraft winds resulted in damage on the south side of the tornado track and in addition to the damage to Sutton itself, areas east of Clay Center, southwest of Sutton through northwest of Grafton were affected.  Power poles and trees were damaged or snapped, irrigation pivots were overturned, and a few homes and outbuildings suffered damage.||Damage from this tornado was first noted north of Fairfield, where large tree limbs were knocked down and power poles broken.  The tornado shifted mainly east across Highway 14 south of Clay Center, with additional tree damage as well as irrigation pivots overturned.  It then started to move to the northeast, crossing Highway 41 east of Clay Center and Highway 6 a few miles west of Sutton, but powerful rear flank downdraft winds of 100 mph hammered Sutton and areas south-southwest of town, causing widespread property damage.

A strong 100 knot jet streak was at the base of the trough at 300 mb, placing the Central Plains in the favorable left front quadrant. An expansive stratus cloud deck, on the cool side of the front, resulted in a substantial temperature gradient across the front, with afternoon temperatures in the 40s and 50s across much of Nebraska to the mid 80s and low 90s over northern Kansas. This resulted in a tight instability gradient with MLCAPE of 2000 J/kg right along the front. Winds were strong throughout the column. The ejecting low pressure center, combined with the front, resulted in significantly backed winds, enhancing low-level shear. 0-1 km SRH was roughly 300 m2/s2, with 0-3 km SRH 400-600 m2/s2. The environment was very favorable for severe storms and tornadoes.",303

High end EF2 damage was done to one brick home where the roof was completely removed and some external walls were knocked down. The tornado continued northeast crossing Yankee Hill Rd less than a mile from State Highway 76A, and this is where the most significant damage occurred. Here a well built brick home had the roof completely removed, exterior walls knocked down, and a couple of interior walls downed as well. The tornado continued northeast while widening, but generally decreasing in intensity as it crossed Denton and Old Cheney Roads. The tornado reached its maximum width to the southwest of Beaver Crossing before moving directly into town. Widespread damage was observed in Beaver Crossing with nearly every structure in town sustaining some damage. In the city scattered EF2 damage was noted with several structures having thier roofs removed. Otherwise most of the damage was tree, power line and outbuildings being destroyed.

Damage in this area was consistent with wind speeds around 75 miles per hour. The tornado continued across Highway 35 and Federal Road, where a farmstead was struck. A barn at this location sustained heavy damage, with much of the roof being removed as well as some wall failure. Wind speeds at this location were estimated to be around 85 miles per hour. |The tornado then crossed Highway 72 and damaged a property heavily. At this location, several fences and outbuildings were completely destroyed. The residential home had windows blown out and significant roof damage. Roof damage was also seen on nearby barns, and several large trees on the property were snapped off and broken. A trailer was also tipped over. Wind speeds at that location were estimated to be around 105 miles per hour. ||On nearby Turnbull Road near a stone quarry, the tornado heavily damaged another property. Here, a detached garage was completely destroyed. A small pickup was briefly lifted and dragged from its location in the garage to the middle of a field about 75 yards away. Significant roof damage was found to the home at the property, with numerous uprooted trees. A lawn tractor was thrown and deposited several hundred yards away. A convergent pattern in the field debris and bean stubble just to the south of this property showed the path of the actual tornado. Wind speeds at this location were estimated to be 125 miles per hour. ||The tornado then crossed the stone quarry and intensified, hitting a farmstead on barrier road directly. Here, complete loss of a residential home built in the 1880���s was observed. All exterior walls failed and the home collapsed, which led to very little interior wall integrity remaining. A close inspection of the foundation found very little reinforcement for the exterior walls. Healthy hardwood trees were debarked and reduced to trunks with only stubs of large branches remaining. Several large grain silos were completely lifted and thrown well downstream up to a half mile away. Based on damage surveyed at this location, the maximum estimated wind speed of this tornado was 145 miles per hour. The tornado then hit another residence on Barber Road, where portions of the exterior walls were removed as well as the roof. Extensive mud spatter covered all four sides of the residence. ||From there, the tornado weakened considerably as it moved parallel to Townsley Road and debris from upstream locations covered farm fields as it fell out of the weakening circulation. A barn on Townsley Road suffered minor roof damage, with winds estimated here at 80 miles per hour. The tornado then weakened further and lifted very close to the Greene and Clark County line.","Numerous thunderstorms developed along and ahead of a slow moving cold front during the afternoon and evening.

A side wall of the building was completely blown out and a dumpster was tossed. Another house on Cole Road had siding shingles ripped off and windows blown out of the house as well.  Numerous trees and power lines were downed as well.||The tornado crossed Interstate 88 in Princetown.  Strong winds associated with the tornado caused two tractor trailer trucks to flip over on the highway.  Trees along the highway were sheared off as well.||The tornado continued south and affected homes in Delanson.  Shingles were blown off a house and damaged a greenhouse at 4155 Schoharie Turnpike and another home at Crow Hill Road had damage to siding and a garage, which was lifted off its foundation and collapsed.||The tornado weakened, but continued to move south towards the Albany County line.","A potent shortwave trough was moving from the eastern Great Lakes towards upstate New York during the afternoon on Thursday, May 22nd.  A complex frontal system was moving from west to east during the mid afternoon hours, with the triple point of where the occluded, cold and warm fronts meet situated over the Mohawk Valley.  There was a significant gradient along the warm front, between warm and unstable air over the Mohawk Valley and cooler, more stable air over far eastern New York that originated off the western Atlantic Ocean.||As a result, a large supercell thunderstorm developed along this boundary over the southern Adirondacks and eastern Mohawk Valley and it quickly strengthened.  It produced very large hail as large as 4 inches in diameter in the Amsterdam area.  As this storm continued to strengthen even further, it moved south to southeast towards the Helderbergs and western parts of the Capital Region, where it produced a tornado.  The tornado was on the ground for 7 miles and reached EF3 strength with maximum winds of 140 MPH, as it passed through the town of Duanesburg. The tornado dissipated once it reached western Albany County, and the more stable air in place allowed thunderstorms to weaken as they reached the Hudson Valley.

Numerous businesses, homes, mobile homes, a National Guard building and power poles and lines were heavily damaged or destroyed by the tornado. One well-built home was mostly destroyed and nearly reduced to a slab. This home received the highest damage rating. Extensive tree damage also occurred along the path of the storm. Maximum wind speed of this tornado was 165mph.","During the afternoon of Dec 23, just enough ingredients came together to support numerous severe storms ahead of a cold front. Across the Lower Mississippi River Valley, peak heating contributed to decent instability in the developing warm sector in advance of the front. Sufficient low level wind shear and strong winds aloft were also in place as a decent upper low was located to our north. This helped to support organized thunderstorm activity along with quite a few supercell storms.||A long lived, persistent, storm tracked across the southeastern counties (near Columbia, Mississippi to Sumrall and Laurel to Heidelberg, Mississippi line) and produced multiple tornadoes. Widespread damage occurred in southern Columbia and near Laurel. Additional damage occurred across Marion, Jones and Clarke counties. Sadly, five confirmed fatalities occurred, with three near Columbia in Marion County and two near Laurel in Jones County. Severe storms moved out of the region by late afternoon to early Tuesday evening. The front continued to track through the area through the evening of December 23.",320

At its strongest, peak winds were estimated to be 200 mph which occurred during this segment of the storm.  The tornado entered Ogle County just west of IL-38 and moved northeast where it ripped the roof off of a small barn.  A neighborhood was hit on S Skare Court where damage was consistent with EF-3.  Some of the homes had large sections of the roofs ripped off while some less well constructed homes (nails instead of bolts) had collapsed walls.  The tornado continued northeast and intensified to EF-4 where several well constructed homes along South Richard Road and East Kuehl Court were completely destroyed with the slab swept clean.  Several outbuildings were destroyed along East Hemstock Road and South Center Road.  A residence on East Bethal Road received heavy damage with most of the outer walls collapsing.  The tornado once again intensified to EF-4  near IL-251 and IL-64 where well constructed homes were swept clean off their foundation.  A farmstead just northeast of the aforementioned intersection was also swept clean to the foundation.  A heavy barn was thrown and rolled on East Lindenwood Road.  In total, around 30 homes were damaged or destroyed around Rochelle.  The tornado continued into Dekalb County just north of East Quarry Road.

It was about 2500 yards wide and was producing EF-2 damage to trees by the time it reached the Choctaw County border at around 627 pm CDT. ||In Choctaw County, the tornado continued to widen as it moved northeast, producing a damage path of about 1.8 miles across, to the southwest of Boswell. The tornado made a turn to the east at the N4000 Road and maintained an eastward movement until dissipating before reaching the N4090 Road. The tornado destroyed at least three mobile homes. Two injuries occurred in one of the mobile homes, one of which was a critical injury. Numerous homes were damaged by this tornado, with the worst damage including major loss of the roof structure and collapse of a few exterior walls. Numerous outbuildings were also destroyed. A metal, high-voltage transmission tower/truss was destroyed, and numerous power poles were snapped. Many trees were snapped or uprooted in the path.

The storms moved across eastern Oklahoma during the evening hours. Prior to the storms moving into the area, the atmosphere ahead of the dry line in eastern Oklahoma had become very unstable. This instability, combined with very strong wind shear associated with a strong trough of low pressure that moved into the Southern Plains from the Southern Rockies, resulted in the development of supercell thunderstorms. One of these supercells produced multiple tornadoes as it tracked along and near an outflow boundary from morning thunderstorms, which had settled across southeastern Oklahoma by the afternoon.

The tornado was captured on video or camera by numerous individuals. The tornado appeared to have more than one vortex at several different points along its path. The tornado moved through some residential and commercial neighborhoods just outside the northern city limits of Mayfield. A car dealership on U.S. Highway 45 right near the city limit received extensive damage, including the loss of almost all 40 vehicles on the lot as well as a nearby storage building. The peak wind speed of 140 mph was assigned at this car lot. A flea market type of business on Highway 121 just outside Mayfield was destroyed by winds near 135 mph. Once the tornado reached the northern edge of Mayfield, it tracked almost parallel to the Purchase Parkway (future Interstate 69). The center of the tornado stayed about one-half mile north of the parkway, crossing Kentucky Highways 131 and 301 prior to reaching the Marshall County line. The average path width was approximately 300 yards. Peak wind speeds were estimated near 140 mph. The tornado continued into Marshall County very close to where the parkway crosses the county line.","An outbreak of supercells with large hail and isolated tornadoes affected western Kentucky during the afternoon and early evening. The initial round of thunderstorms occurred early in the afternoon over northwest Kentucky. These storms, which produced a major hailstorm and flash flood in the Owensboro area, were triggered by a weak upper-level low over northern Illinois. This initial round of thunderstorms produced an outflow of cooler air that settled south into southwest Kentucky. By mid-afternoon, isolated supercells with tornadoes fired up along the leading edge of cooler air. Strong westerly upper-level winds associated with the upper-level low over Illinois provided ample wind shear for supercells. A southwest wind flow of moist and unstable air in the lower levels of the atmosphere provided fuel for the storms. Low-level winds up to around 40 knots enhanced low-level wind shear, providing a favorable environment for tornadoes. The supercells lingered well into the evening.",362

Eyewitness reports from storm chasers and spotters in the area indicate that the tornado began at 6:13 pm CDT just south of Texas State Highway 176, approximately 10 miles west of Big Spring.  The tornado then moved southeastward over open fields, bounded by Natural Dam Lake to its west and Wilkinson Road just to its east.  The tornado continued on this southeast track along Salt Lake, eventually crossing Interstate 20 at approximately 6:32 pm CDT.  ||South of Interstate 20, the tornado exhibited erratic movement, being described by chasers and spotters as being nearly stationary in a field.  Examination of radar imagery showed the primary storm circulation moved slowly southeastward to approximately half a mile northwest of the intersection of Lintner Road and Rockhouse Road by 6:37 pm CDT, before turning eastward.  The tornado continued to move east, with the southern periphery of the tornado affecting Home #1.  The tornado then began to move northeastward, crossing nearly directly over Home #2 around 6:40 pm CDT.  A slight east northeast turn allowed for only the tornado's northern periphery to affect Home #3 along Cauble Road around 6:42 pm CDT.||The tornado moved southward along or near Cauble Road.  The tornado continued its erratic behavior, moving southwestward and re-entering the same field as previous around 6:48 pm CDT.  The tornado then turned west-northwestward, eventually becoming quasi-stationary just east of the Home #1 between 6:52 pm and 6:54 pm CDT, before moving westward, just north of Home #1.  Residents at home #1 described how long the tornado lasted and felt the tornado had impacted them twice. The tornado dissipated approximately 1.5 miles west of Home #1 around 7 pm CDT.||The damage assessment team looked at several different indicators to determine tornado intensity.  At Home #2, which likely was the closest and strongest structure to the tornado during the most intense portion of the tornado's life cycle, the entire roof was destroyed and exterior walls on this well-constructed residence were partially collapsed.  This damage indicator suggests an EF-3 intensity with wind speeds estimated at 140-160 mph.  In the adjacent field east of Home #2, a 640 type pump jack was blown over.  The assessment team also looked at tree damage at Home #2.  Both softwood and hardwood trees were viewed on the property.  Damage to these large trees was indicative of high end EF-2 to low end EF-3 damage.||Home #1 and Home #3 experienced tornado damage indicative of EF-2 damage.  In the examples shown, large sections of the roof were removed, but with the walls still standing.  At Home #3, there were power poles that were snapped approximately five feet off the ground.  Wind speeds at this residence are estimated at 115 to 125 mph.  At Home #1, trees were uprooted.  Wind speeds are estimated at this location of 105 to 115 mph.

This tornado quickly grew to a large tornado, becoming slightly less than one mile wide at its widest point. The tornado was at the strongest near Interstate 20 and FM 17 just north of Canton. The survey crews found continuous damage between Canton and Fruitvale, and then additional damage as far north as Emory, |and Lake Fork. Several homes, businesses, and farm buildings were damaged or destroyed in the 40 mile continuous damage path. This tornado occurred for over an hour, and spanned most of Van Zandt, and nearly all of Rains Counties during the 80 minute track.","A deep low pressure system near the Four corners continued to move east, causing early morning thunderstorms to develop along the Texas Panhandle and into Oklahoma. A cold front was moving southeast across the state and entered our northwestern|counties around sunrise. The strength of the cap was sufficient to hamper any development until mid afternoon. Deep forcing for ascent approached from from the west while remnant boundaries associated with convection over far East Texas and West Louisiana moved in from the east. By 3:30 PM, several parameters came together for the rapid development of severe storms east of Interstate 35/35E. Pre-frontal convection led to the development of supercells, producing numerous tornadoes over a relatively small area. Additional storm development quickly developed along the cold front with several reports of large hail, and eventually producing a brief EF-0 Quasi-Linear Convective System (QLCS) tornado (Tornado #7). ||The survey crew teams determined yesterday that there was a nearly 55 mile damage swath, yet found evidence that there were two tornadoes which caused the damage.

Law Enforcement reported the tornado just south of the county line near Pawnee Rock and then followed it as it moved to the NE.  The tornado moved through the west side of Pawnee Rock causing sporadic EF1 and isolated EF2 damage to several homes and one school type facility.  The tornado continued to move to the NNE causing EF2 damage to a couple of homes on West Barton County Road.  One residence was a mobile home that lost the far east side of the structure and all roofing material.  One injury was noted at that location as they did not seek shelter.  The home just to the west lost the east half of structure with the occupants seeking refuge in the basement.  Of note, a Ford F-150 was thrown or rolled approximately 75 to hundred yards away from its original location.  Further to the NE, the tornado strengthened considerably as noted by complete destruction of an 1890 farm house.  With the age of the home and no anchoring being present due to the structure resting on cinder blocks along with a lack of debarking, a higher rating could not be justified though the amount of devastation to the structure itself pointed towards a possible higher rating.  Three occupants sought refuge in the basement and were unharmed.  The next door neighbor's home was also considerably damaged with all of the structure being demolished except for one corner section. The tornado then continued to the NE over open country damaging trees and power lines along the way before dissipating NW of Hoisington. A total of 44 parcels were affected. Ten homes were deemed total losses.  The estimated property value losses were estimated at $658,000.","A cyclic supercell thunderstorm produced a long track tornado across portions of Barton county, Kansas.

The tornado first touched down west of US Highway 431 north of town of Wellington, where it rapidly intensified and widened. It snapped and uprooted numerous trees along US Highway 431. Several homes were damaged by the falling trees. The tornado proceeded eastward across Websters Road and Broughton Road with scattered tree damage. As the tornado crossed Old Sulphur Springs Road, two homes were damaged with scores of trees snapped or uprooted. At Angel Station Road, the tornado filled the valley from one side to the other and caused extensive tree and home damage. An electrical transmission tower line was toppled at this point, but it was believed that flying debris compromised the structure. The tornado continued eastward and destroyed the sanctuary at West Point Baptist Church. Additional structures were severely damaged at the church. The tornado entered the City of Jacksonville where it gained strength into the EF3 category, with winds around 140 mph. It removed most of the roof and the top floor of two buildings in an apartment complex. The tornado affected the entire campus of Jacksonville State University. Several buildings sustained significant damage. The most intense winds remained north of the campus however, mowing down trees and causing direct damage to homes. As the tornado crossed Highway 21, it caused caused major damage to the Merrill Building. It then moved into a highly populated zone, where scores of homes suffered major damage and rendered uninhabitable. The tornado maintained its strength as it crossed Choccolocco Mountain, and winds funneled up the valley uprooting or snapping trees. It caused major damage to a number of homes on the mountainside. Damaged continued all the way up to just south of the peak of the mountain. As the tornado moved down the eastern side of Choccolocco Mountain, it narrowed substantially and became stronger once it reached the valley below. Stands of trees were wiped out with trunks snapped relatively close to ground level. Perhaps the most intense damage along the entire track occurred along Hollingsworth Road, where a site built home was completely destroyed with only a portion of one interior wall left standing. Debris from this home was blown downstream across a field with some evidence of wind rowing. Hay bales adjacent to the home, estimated at 800 pounds each, were thrown up to 300 yards to the east. Maximum winds at this location were estimated at 150 mph. The tornado continued east-southeast and downed thousands of trees in the Talladega National Forest and crossed into Cleburne County just south of County Road 534.","Six tornadoes and hail up to 3 inches in diameter affected the northern areas of Central Alabama on the afternoon and evening hours of March 19th, with a rare PDS (Particularly Dangerous Situation) Tornado Watch issued for a large portion of Central Alabama. An environment favorable for significant severe thunderstorms developed as a low-amplitude upper-level trough moved into the region with a deepening surface low passing across far north Alabama.  These two features resulted in a deep column of strong wind shear with 0-6km Bulk Shear values of 60-70 knots. Additionally, moist southerly flow, warm surface temperatures, and colder temperatures aloft yielded a moderately unstable air mass. Initially, thunderstorms were producing large to very large hail.

This was only the third EF3 tornado to occur in the NWS Blacksburg forecast since 1950, and was the longest track tornado within the state of Virginia for the NWS Blacksburg forecast area. The tornado reached its peak intensity with estimated maximum winds of 150 MPH as it crossed Route 130 and entered the town of Elon.  A total of 166 homes suffered damage, and 22 of those homes were considered a total loss.  A motor home was carried about thirty feet and tipped over.  The hardest hit locations were along Nottaway Drive and Deerfield Drive.  Seven people were injured and taken to the hospital from Elon.  As the tornado continued north-northeastward out of Elon, it snapped or uprooted hundreds of trees and caused more minor roof damage to homes.

As the tornado continued, it snapped and uprooted many more trees and took down power lines and power poles. Many more homes were damaged, to a lesser extent than the first few on the south end of town, with some damage to the homes coming from trees or tree branches falling on the homes. As the tornado moved into the northern part of Hewittville, the wind speeds seemed to increase, completely destroying another home and destroying a large, old building that had been part of an old rail-yard. The tornado also damaged other homes and garages in this area. The tornado was rated EF3 with wind speeds of 155mph at this location. As the tornado tracked north-northeastward, it moved into Taylorville, taking down more trees, power lines/poles, and damaging multiple houses. Several homes lost roofs and garages. The tornado continued through Taylorville damaging other homes and several businesses on West Spresser St. and was rated EF2 with wind speeds of 120-125mph at this point. As the tornado crossed Hwy 29 into the northern part of town, it weakened considerably, with the damage becoming less severe and more sporadic.  The tornado dissipated 1.8 miles north of Taylorville at 5:25 PM CST.  In total, the tornado impacted 506 structures...including major damage to 61 homes and 7 businesses and complete destruction of 28 homes.  Total damage was estimated at $118.9 million.","An historic tornado outbreak occurred across Illinois on December 1st, with a total of 29 tornadoes touching down across the central part of the state.  This made it the largest December tornado outbreak in the state of Illinois since 1957, and the third largest tornado outbreak across Illinois in any month since 1950.  Within the National Weather Service Lincoln County Warning Area (CWA), 20 tornadoes touched down...with the most significant being an EF-3 tornado that tore through the city of Taylorville in Christian County.  Despite several communities being directly impacted and experiencing major damage, there were no fatalities reported.  The severe weather was caused by a deep area of low pressure that tracked from eastern Kansas into north-central Illinois.  Warm air surging northward ahead of the low allowed temperatures to soar into the upper 50s and lower 60s, resulting in a narrow corridor of Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) values of 500-1000J/kg ahead of an approaching occluded front.  Thanks to ample low-level wind shear, numerous supercell thunderstorms developed within the instability axis by mid to late afternoon.  Many of the storms produced tornadoes over the next several hours before the storms gradually weakened by mid-evening.",414

The maximum estimated winds in Southern Rusk County was near 105 mph primarily in the area of County Roads 4265 and 4238.","A strong upper level trough entered the Southern Plains during the afternoon hours of April 12th, which allowed southerly low level winds to gradually return warm and moist air from the Gulf of Mexico north into East Texas and North Louisiana. An upper level disturbance ejecting northeast ahead of the trough across portions of East Texas and North Louisiana during the early morning hours of April 13th carried enough elevated instability, shear, and forcing north of an advancing warm front over Southeast Texas and South Louisiana, such that scattered strong to severe thunderstorms developed, with numerous reports of large hail and occasional damaging winds received. The warm front continued to gradually mix north northwest into East Texas and Northcentral Louisiana by late morning and early afternoon hours, with a very warm, moist, and unstable air mass noted over Deep East Texas and portions of Northcentral Louisiana south of the front. Coupled with even stronger forcing and low level shear ahead of the approaching upper trough, additional strong to severe thunderstorms developed near and south of the front from late morning through the afternoon, producing numerous reports of damaging winds with several tornadoes across portions of East Texas. These showers and thunderstorms diminished by early evening with the departure of the trough, and the arrival of an associated cold front which brought about cooler, drier, and more stable air southeast into the region.",425

It continued northeast, crossing South Maple Street where the tornado intensified, resulting in widespread tree damage just south of Highway 3012 along Wade Drive, Lind Drive, Robert Street, University Boulevard, and Shelor Drive. Many of these streets were impassable due to the significant number of trees snapped, twisted, and uprooted. Many more trees were downed on Highway 3012 before the tornado tracked northeast towards Westwood Drive. It uprooted a number of trees onto fraternity houses before it crossed the Kansas City Southern Railroad. The tornado crossed the railroad and bent or uprooted several large light poles on Louisiana Tech's softball, baseball, and neighboring athletic fields. It snapped a number of power poles as well. The tornado crossed Tech Drive and damaged a number of dormitories where it removed their metal roofs and blew out windows. It continued northeast where it uprooted more trees on Louisiana Tech's and Ruston High School's campuses. The estimated winds as the tornado tore through the western and northern sections of Louisiana Tech University ranged from 115-130 mph. The tornado crossed Greenwood Cemetery where it intensified again, resulting in a large number of trees being debarked with just the stubs of the large branches remaining in several areas. It continued with several business sustaining significant damage to their exterior brick walls and some interior walls. A hotel along Interstate 20 suffered the collapse of its top story's exterior walls. The tornado continued on to severely damage a gas station between Trenton and Vienna Streets just south of I-20, before crossing the interstate and weakened slightly but still resulted in considerable roof damage to several businesses along North Service Road East. The tornado then began to weaken, with more sporadic wind damage noted as it moved northeast towards Farmerville Highway. It crossed Farmerville Highway near Timberline Court uprooting a number of trees and continued northeast towards Haddox Road. The tornado then lifted and touched back down a few more times with the intermittent damage noted for the rest of its path. It uprooted a few more trees along Stable and Baxter Roads, destroyed a chicken house along Highway 820, before finally lifting just south of Oak Tree Road.

In all, approximately 1220 structures were affected by this tornado throughout Lincoln Parish.||Entergy Power Company concluded that 35 power poles were broken throughout the city of Ruston, with numerous spans of power lines also downed. Given the extensive damage throughout the city of Ruston, mandatory curfews were enforced by the Ruston Police Department, Lincoln Parish Sheriff's Department, and the Louisiana State Police.","A strong closed upper level low pressure system advanced east across Central Texas during the evening hours of April 24th, which helped to mix a warm front north into portions of Deep East Texas and Northcentral Louisiana. As a result, warm, moist, and unstable air began to build north along and south of the front, as steepening lapse rates aloft spread east along the axis of increasing large scale forcing ahead of the low. This resulted in an increase in scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms near and south of the warm front from the late evening hours of the 24th through the early morning hours of the 25th across East Texas and North Louisiana. Coupled with the strong wind shear present across the expanding warm sector, several supercell thunderstorms developed, with one supercell spawning six separate tornadoes from San Augustine Texas northeast to Eastern Union Parish Louisiana, directly impacting the cities of San Augustine Texas and Ruston Louisiana along its 150+ mile track across the NWS Shreveport County Warning Area. In fact, this supercell spawned another tornado across Northwest Morehouse and Southern Ashley County Arkansas, to complete its nearly 180 mile track before dissipating.

At least two other barns also lost nearly half of their metal roofing in the vicinity of Bunker Hill Road. Numerous trees in this area, with trunk diameters of 18 to 24 inches, were also snapped and blown down in various directions. This type of damage was consistent with wind speeds of up to 90 mph and associated with an EF1 tornado. ||The next damage occurred to homes and adjacent outbuildings along Mud Pike Road, immediately southeast of the intersection with State Route 118. Two homes retained their main roof structure but many shingles were removed. Two outbuildings and a larger barn were destroyed, likely resulting from EF1 tornado winds of 100 to 110 mph. Additional damage occurred along Hellwarth Road, just south of the intersection with Fairground Road. Several homes and outbuildings were damaged, with the most serious being a home that lost much of its roof and some exterior walls. High-end EF2 tornado winds of 125 to 135 mph likely caused the worst damage at this location. ||The tornado path continued generally along Fairground Road from just east of the intersection with Hellwarth Road to the western corporation limit of the city of Celina. Homes, outbuildings, trees and utility poles were damaged here, and a free-standing cellular communication tower was knocked down. At least two homes suffered partial roof loss and one home lost its entire roof. The cellular tower was a lattice structure at least 300 feet tall and two of the three support attachments at the ground were broken. A 50 to 100 yard swath of trees were snapped and uprooted in a forested area leading up to the western edge of Celina. The damage to the cellular tower and trees was indicative of EF2 tornado wind speeds of 125 to 135 mph. ||More substantial damage was observed just inside the western corporation limit of the city of Celina, along Fairground Road. At least a dozen homes were severely damaged here, with roofs completely uplifted and removed, along with many exterior walls collapsed. One residence was completely lifted from its foundation, with interior walls largely intact, and dropped in an adjoining field approximately 70 yards to the north-northeast. This residence was anchored to a cinder block foundation, with the upper level or two of blocks breaking from the rest under the force of the wind. Significant mud spatter was also observed on what remained of these homes, especially on the north and northeast facing sides, implying a strongly rotating column of air in contact with a nearby muddy field. This type of damage was consistent with wind speeds up to 150 mph and associated with an EF3 tornado. In this area along Fairground Road, a vehicle was thrown into a house, killing a person inside of the house. ||Significant damage continued into a cluster of homes near and northwest of the intersection of Fairground Road and Touvelle Street in Celina. At least two dozen of these homes had partial or complete roof failure and many exterior walls collapsed. Two residences on either side of Jill Avenue were missing large portions of their exterior walls, indicative of winds as high as 140 to 150 mph and associated with an EF3 tornado. Evidence of multiple vortices within the tornado was also evident in the debris pattern here. Several cars were displaced by the wind and uplift in this neighborhood. A thick layer of mud was also spattered on the east and northeast facing sides of these structures, largely opposite the direction of the incoming tornado. ||The degree and extent of damage started to gradually lessen east-northeast from near Touvelle Street to U.S. 127. From there the tornado continued to track farther northeast to near the community of Neptune. An approximately 100 yard swath of trees were snapped and uprooted in a small forested area between U.S. 127 and Celina-Mendon Road, north of Myers Road. A garage roof was displaced off the main structure along Celina-Mendon Road, between State Route 197 and Howick Road, causing exterior walls to also collapse. This damage was likely the result of EF2 tornado winds of 115 to 125 mph. ||A garage was destroyed along State Route 197, just northeast of the intersection with Rice Road. A house farther northeast along Riley Road, just south of the intersection with State Route 197, suffered partial roof removal along with the collapse of a few exterior walls. Based on the damage, wind speeds here were estimated to be at the upper-end of the EF1 range, between 100 and 110 mph.

It moved east and entered Miami County at 2128EST along Hall Road, about a half mile northwest of Potsdam. ||As the tornado entered Miami County, significant tree damage occurred on State Route 721 south of Laura. Structural damage began to occur near the intersection of Wright Road and Markley Road, with partial roof loss to an outbuilding. On Ditmer Road and South Shiloh Road, nearly every property sustained tree damage, some of which was significant.||As the tornado neared State Route 571, structural damage became much more severe. Several homes on State Route 571 between South Shiloh Road and South Range Line Road were rendered uninhabitable. Many homes had at least partial roof removal and some sustained complete roof removal. A few homes suffered the collapse of some exterior walls and while this was more common with garage walls, it also occurred on a few well-built walls away from garages. At one home, a lawn tractor was thrown out into the adjacent field to the northeast.||Damage was very similar across the field on South Range Line Road. Two homes experienced complete roof removal, with one also having walls collapse on multiple sides of the second story of the home. Mud splatter on all sides of structures was significant, and one vehicle interior was largely covered in mud after the failure of the rear window. Another home lost a significant portion of the roof, as well as losing quite a bit of material from an interior wall after the winds had entered the structure.  The rotating winds of the tornado were very obvious on this north-to-south oriented road. Along the northern portion of the tornado track, one home lost its entire roof and had it deposited hundreds of feet into the field to the west, opposite the direction of motion of the tornado. Along the southern portion of the tornado track, debris accumulated across the field, along a tree line over a quarter mile away to the east.||The width of this tornado was most evident as it passed east across Elleman Road. Damage was observed as far south as the intersection with State Route 571 and as far north as several spots along State Route 55. While the damage on State Route 55 was primarily to roofing material and trees, more significant structural damage continued to be observed a little farther south on Elleman Road.||The tornado maintained its intensity as it crossed State Route 48 about a mile and a half north of downtown West Milton. Tree damage was severe along this road, with canopy loss even to trees that remained standing. Many structures were heavily damaged or destroyed. The only known injury from this tornado occurred when a trailer home was flipped over. A well-built brick home suffered the collapse of large portions of the west-facing and south-facing walls, with near-complete roof removal. A garage adjacent to this property was flattened. A trailer home just to the south was completely destroyed, with the failure of nearly all exterior walls and even some interior walls. Debris from these homes and structures was carried about a half mile across the field, stopped only by the tree line from traveling farther.||Widespread tree damage and moderate structural damage continued to be observed as the tornado moved east across Calumet Road, Kessler-Frederick Road, and Kessler Road. One home on Kessler Road lost its entire roof and a full-size camper was thrown and wedged against the garage.||Less significant damage was observed after passing Kessler Road, where the tornado turned from the east to the southeast. Damage observed on Nashville Road south of West Kessler Cowlesville Road was limited to trees, and it is believed that the tornado dissipated somewhere in this vicinity.||This tornado was responsible for a lengthy swath of EF2 level damage, generally 120 to 130 mph, extending from State Route 571 to Kessler Road. However, damage to a few homes on State Route 571, South Range Line Road, and State Route 48, was notably more significant, with a combined degree of roof loss and exterior wall collapse that warranted an estimate of 140 mph winds, within the EF3 category.","Thunderstorms developed during the evening hours along a warm front lifting slowly north across the region.

This tornado tracked toward the east-northeast, crossing I-35E and impacted numerous commercial structures between this freeway and Harry Hines Blvd.||Extensive damage to many businesses and residences, consistent with EF-1 and EF-2 intensity wind speeds, occurred near the intersection of Harry Hines Blvd and Walnut Hill Lane. As the tornado moved eastward, roughly coincident with Walnut Hill Lane, several gas stations, large commercial buildings, and churches, and at least one multi-story apartment complex sustained significant roof and exterior wall damage. This path of strong EF-1 and EF-2 damage continued east-northeast along Walnut Hill Lane through the Marsh Lane and Midway Road corridors. East of Marsh Lane, the tornado impacted more single-family residences, though commercial structures were still adversely affected at times. Severe damage to large hardwood trees, consistent with EF-1 intensity winds, was observed throughout the damage path from Marsh Lane to US HWY 75. ||Intermittent EF-1 and EF-2 damage also occurred to a number of residences in this area. Many of these damaged homes were large and/or well-established structures that sustained either partial or total roof loss, accompanied by minor exterior wall damage. This damage was consistent with 110-125 mph tornado winds. Within one concentrated region of EF-2 damage along Northaven Road west of US HWY 75, a particular single-family home was surveyed with total roof loss, and multiple collapsed exterior walls. The survey team determined that this damage was consistent with low-end EF-3 intensity winds of approximately 140 mph. This was the only structure that was assigned an EF-3 rating for this tornado. ||The tornado continued eastward, toward US HWY 75 and produced significant roof damage to several businesses near US HWY 75 including office low-rise buildings, a car dealership, and a Home Depot. Damage here was assigned an EF-2 intensity. The tornado crossed over the southern part of the Texas Instruments campus and then began to turn more northeastward and parallel Greenville Avenue. Tree and roof damage consistent with EF-1 occurred as it crossed I-635. Several glass windows were blown out at a mid-rise office building. The tornado crossed an apartment complex near Walnut Street and Greenville Avenue where dozens of units had sections of missing roof consistent with EF-1 damage of 95-110 mph. The tornado moved across the Cutters Point apartment complex where numerous units experienced significant roof loss consistent with 115 mph or EF-2 damage. Another low-rise office building saw numerous windows blown out on all sides. The tornado continued into the Richland Park, Lakes of Buckingham, Richland Meadows, and College Park residential subdivisions where widespread tree and roof damage consistent with 80-95 mph winds occurred. A few homes in this area saw complete or total roof loss where winds were estimated at 110 mph or EF-1. The tornado began to weaken and took a sharp turn to the north near Richardson Square where it tracked to the Huffhines Park areas. Mostly tree damage occurred here with winds estimated near 70 mph or EF-0. The track then turned to the east and became very narrow near Duck Creek with the tornado dissipating as it crossed Jupiter Rd. The tornado had a continuous track for 32 minutes, tracked for just over 15 miles, produced maximum winds of 140 mph, with a maximum width of three-quarters of a mile.","Thunderstorms erupted across the DFW Metroplex as a strong upper level system and a cold front impacted the region on the evening of October 20 through the early morning hours of October 21st. A few storms developed ahead of the approaching cold front in the late evening hours of the 20th, producing tornadoes in Dallas and surrounding areas. Additional storms formed a squall line along the cold front, producing a large swath of damaging winds across North and Central Texas overnight into the early hours of October 21st. A total of 10 tornadoes were identified by NWS Survey teams, occurring both within the storms ahead of the cold front, and embedded within the squall line. The strongest of these tornadoes was an EF-3 that stretched almost 16 miles across the northern portions of Dallas County. Following on the heels of that tornado, an EF-2 tracked about 2.5 miles through Garland in Dallas County. The remaining count of tornadoes included 4 EF-1s and 4 EF-0s. Miraculously, no one was killed or significantly injured in any of the tornadoes! The total estimated cost of insured damage for all the tornadoes alone is over $2 billion, which the Insurance Council of Texas claims is the most costly tornado event in the state's history. Of the straight line wind damage, the most severe was located in Farmersville in Collin Co where a mobile home was rolled and destroyed. Three people were injured in the home.

As it moved through this area, it downed and snapped hundreds of trees, many of which fell onto homes. As the tornado crossed Sandal Street, it caused minor structural damage to several single-wide manufactured homes before tipping over a trailer as it crossed Jonesboro Road. The tornado then proceeded onward to break the metal trusses and bring down a wood chip conveyor belt onto a train at the Graphic Packaging International Paper Mill. As the tornado continued, it crossed the Ouachita River twice where it bends sharply before increasing intensity along Riverbend Drive. This increase in intensity was most notable from the many tree trunks snapped, the roof ripped off of a single family home, and the collapsed wall of another single family home. ||The tornado then crossed the Ouachita River again and partially damaged the roof of the Masur Museum of Art, missing Downtown Monroe by roughly a mile. As it crossed South Grand Street, it then ripped the roof off of a two story home and continued on to damage the roofs of several homes and downed trees until it crossed the intersection of Highway 165 and Interstate 20. There, it damaged a metal building structure and snapped a wooden power pole and steel light assembly as it crossed Millhaven Road. Numerous other power poles were snapped and blown over across Millhaven Road. Two semi trucks were also blown over near the Highway 165/Interstate 20 intersection as well. ||The worst damage from the tornado then occurred along Orchid Drive where it ripped the roof off of three homes and collapsed much of the exterior walls of one of the homes. It is believed that a mesovortex within the tornado led to this narrow corridor of more intense damage. After the tornado moved out of this subdivision, damage became more sporadic and the tornado touch down several more times before it destroyed a metal hangar housing several airplanes at the Monroe Regional Airport. The tornado then lifted as it crossed a runway at the airport. ||Initial estimates from the Ouachita Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness indicate that a total of 458 homes across the parish were impacted by this tornado and the two other tornadoes which also touched down near the Sterlington community in Northern Ouachita Parish that same morning of April 12th. Of these homes, 23 homes were destroyed, 108 had major damage, 243 with minor damage, and another 84 homes were affected across the parish. Damage at the Monroe Regional Airport alone was estimated at $25-30 million. According to Entergy, South Monroe lost seven distribution lines and one substation as a result of this tornado. Several other circuits and transmission structures were also damaged.","Warm, moist, and unstable air surged north into East Texas, North Louisiana, and Southern Arkansas during the evening through the early morning hours of April 11th-12th, along a warm front that lifted north across much of East Texas into North Louisiana.

As the tornado moved east northeast to Tynes Ainsworth Road, it tossed and completely destroyed a mobile home, causing two fatalities. Concurrently, it also snapped numerous softwood and hardwood trees behind and around the mobile home. The snapping and uprooting of numerous softwood trees continued when it moved northeast across Felix Sartin Road, while also causing some shingles to be removed from a one-story residence. Swaths of snapped hardwood trees and the uproot of trees was noted at Holmes Road, where a few wooden power poles were also snapped. The tornado then trekked into northwest Marion County, causing the snapping of multiple softwood trees just north of Ranch Road. The tornado moved northeast to US Road 587 where it broke a few wooden power poles and continued snapping softwood trees. It continued along its east-northeast path impacting River Road and Cooper Road, and causing large softwood branches to snap and the snapping and uprooting of softwood trees. The uprooting of a few softwood trees was noted when the tornado reached Highway 13, though the amount of uprooted trees was not as impressive from earlier in its track, thus showing a declining in strength. The tornado moved northeast into Jefferson Davis County, resulting in the snapping of a few small softwood tree limbs at Raynes Road.

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi.

Locations impacted by this tornado include Bassfield, the areas between Collins and Seminary, Soso, Moss, Heidelberg, and Pachuta. This tornado is preliminarily rated EF4 with an estimated peak wind of 190 MPH east of Bassfield in southwestern Jefferson Davis County. Additional EF4 damage was noted near Soso in Jones County and at Moss in Jasper County. The maximum path width was 2.25 miles in the vicinity of Hughes Road west of Seminary in western Covington County. At this width, the tornado ranks 3rd widest in the official NOAA United States tornado database behind the El Reno, OK tornado of 2013 (2.6 mi) and the Hallam, NE tornado of 2004 (2.5 mi). This tornado now ranks as the widest on record in the state of Mississippi, surpassing the Yazoo City, MS tornado of 2010 (1.75 mi). Eight lives were lost in this tornado, and there was an undetermined number of additional injuries. Additional details on the damage path and area of most significant damage follow.|| ||The tornado began south of Bassfield along Bassfield Cemetery Road, uprooting trees and resulting in relatively minor structural damage. As it proceeded northeastward, the diameter of the wind field steadily increased and the percentage of snapped trees in the center of the vortex increased considerably as the tornado approached MS Highway 42. At this location, two homes sustained major roof damage. Tornado intensity then began to increase quickly, with EF3 damage as it crossed Hosey Mikell Road, completely demolishing a mobile home and scattering the debris field over 300 yards downwind. Tree damage also ramped up significantly beyond this location, with low end EF4 damage in a narrow swath of nearly complete tree destruction along the center of the tornado vortex and increasing instances of debarking of trees as the tornado moved across Pitts Lane and Reese Road. Outside of this most intense corridor of tornadic winds, EF1 and EF2 damage to trees and structures was occurring over a wider area, up one mile wide. In addition, both ground surveys and aerial photography indicated the presence of multiple vortices at times. Intense damage continued as the tornado crossed the intersection of Graves Key Road and Harper Road, where a cinder block small business building was destroyed, with much of the slab swept clean. Four fatalities occurred at this location. Nearby, a mobile home was completely destroyed, with the undercarriage wrapped around the small set of trees that remained standing downwind. Debarking of some trees was again noted and continued along the tornado path across Claude Booth Road.|| ||The tornado reached its peak intensity as it moved across a field north of Graves Key Road. At this location, the foundation of a wood frame and metal roof cabin was swept clean. A truck parked at this cabin was tossed approximately 300 yards downwind, and trees that remained standing at this site were partially debarked. Though the path of the intense tornado vortex through the field surrounding this cabin was clearly visible, significant scouring was not noted. The tornado continued to remain violent and grow in size, nearly 1.5 miles wide, as it crossed Good Hope Road and continued to track toward the Bouie River. Here, a large swath of extreme tree damage was noted as the whole forest was leveled. An intense core of the tornado was evident by debarking of trees along a well defined center line or sub-vortex feature. Extreme debarking was noted around Willie Fortenberry Road. In this general area, several farmers reported roughly 60 cattle were killed by the tornado. The tornado grew larger as it entered Covington County and peaked in width in the vicinity of Hughes Road. Maximum width was measured at 2.25 miles. The incredible expansive tree damage continued along the path with millions of trees damaged. Several dozen structures were damaged or destroyed between McGowen Circle to US 49. Numerous chicken houses (23-30) were destroyed here as well. A section of Cold Springs Road looked to see another sub- vortex and it was here another area of EF4 damage occurred to a home.|| ||As the tornado crossed US 49, the width decreased to 1.7 miles, but it remained quite strong with mid to upper end EF3 damage noted. Extreme tree damage persisted in large swaths along the path. In addition, a few dozen structures were damaged between US 49 and MS Highway 588. This consisted of varying degrees of damage from EF1 to EF3 levels. The tornado entered northwestern Jones County near the Centerville community where several homes had shingles blown off or parts of the decking exposed. A mobile home along Tommy Pickering Road was thrown and separated from the frame, with the highest winds in the EF2 range. As the storm moved northeast across US 84, trees were uprooted and snapped. Several homes on both sides of the highway had decking exposed or shingles blown off. At least one mobile home was destroyed along US 84. The tornado intensified to an EF3 causing significant damage to multiple homes along Danny Hillburn Road, where large sections of roofing was removed. Between US 84 and MS Highway 29, several mobile homes were completely destroyed and at least one separated from the frame. Several homes had one or more exterior walls collapsed or large sections of the roof removed. The tornado continued to cause widespread destruction as it moved into the town of Soso. Several homes and churches received significant damage. Large swaths of trees were snapped and uprooted along MS Highway 29. Near the center of town, a fire station was heavily damaged when the overhead doors collapsed and portions of the roof were removed. Numerous homes had roofing removed and exposed decking. The worst damage occurred along MS Highway 28 where a convenience store was destroyed and several other cinder block structures were heavily damaged when the storm intensified to low end EF-4. The tornado continued to mow down large swaths of trees and caused major uplift and loss of roofing to numerous homes as it moved northeast toward MS Highway 15. Along Mathews Road numerous mobile homes and several outbuildings were completely destroyed.|| ||The tornado intensified to a low end EF4 as it moved into the Moss community, where winds near 175 mph resulted in widespread devastation. Nearly every structure in the community was damaged with the most significant damage occurring along or near MS Highway 537. About half of the First Baptist Church of Moss was completely leveled. Numerous homes were destroyed or had major roofing loss or uplifted. A small pick-up truck was thrown several hundred yards and completely destroyed. In addition, multiple mobile homes were completely demolished.|| ||As the storm tracked toward I-59 a few miles west of Heidelberg, hundreds of trees were mowed down, outbuildings were destroyed. Several homes and mobile homes had metal roofing peeled back or decking exposed. Large swaths of trees were snapped for several miles including some along I-59 between the Heidelberg and Vossburg exits. Swaths of tree damage continued into the Barnett community. In the town of Pachuta there was scattered tree damage and the metal roofing was peeled off of a church. About two miles north of Pachuta, the damage became sporadic and the tornado lifted in a wooded area along County Road 130.||The total path length was 67.43 miles.

The tornado intensified to an EF3 causing significant damage to multiple homes along Danny Hillburn Road, where large sections of roofing was removed. Between US 84 and MS Highway 29, several mobile homes were completely destroyed and at least one separated from the frame. Several homes had one or more exterior walls collapsed or large sections of the roof removed. The tornado continued to cause widespread destruction as it moved into the town of Soso. Several homes and churches received significant damage. Large swaths of trees were snapped and uprooted along MS Highway 29. Near the center of town, a fire station was heavily damaged when the overhead doors collapsed and portions of the roof were removed. Numerous homes had roofing removed and exposed decking. The worst damage occurred along MS Highway 28 where a convenience store was destroyed and several other cinder block structures were heavily damaged when the storm intensified to low end EF-4. The tornado continued to mow down large swaths of trees and caused major uplift and loss of roofing to numerous homes as it moved northeast toward MS Highway 15. Along Mathews Road numerous mobile homes and several outbuildings were completely destroyed.|| ||The tornado intensified to a low end EF4 as it moved into the Moss community, where winds near 175 mph resulted in widespread devastation. Nearly every structure in the community was damaged with the most significant damage occurring along or near MS Highway 537. About half of the First Baptist Church of Moss was completely leveled. Numerous homes were destroyed or had major roofing loss or uplifted. A small pick-up truck was thrown several hundred yards and completely destroyed. In addition, multiple mobile homes were completely demolished.|| ||As the storm tracked toward I-59 a few miles west of Heidelberg, hundreds of trees were mowed down, outbuildings were destroyed. Several homes and mobile homes had metal roofing peeled back or decking exposed. Large swaths of trees were snapped for several miles including some along I-59 between the Heidelberg and Vossburg exits. Swaths of tree damage continued into the Barnett community. In the town of Pachuta there was scattered tree damage and the metal roofing was peeled off of a church. About two miles north of Pachuta, the damage became sporadic and the tornado lifted in a wooded area along County Road 130.||The total path length was 67.43 miles. The maximum estimated wind speed of the tornado was 190mph, while the maximum wind speed in Covington County was 170mph.","An outbreak of severe weather occurred on Easter Sunday, 2020. This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low.

Additional details on the damage path and area of most significant damage follow.|| ||The tornado initially touched down in southeastern Lawrence County 11 miles south of the city of Monticello, causing minor tree damage. The tornado quickly strengthened as it took a northeast track, producing EF1 and EF2 tree damage along Givens Road and Divide Road. From an elevated location on Divide Road, surveyors were able to view extensive tree damage and ground scouring in the inaccessible Pearl River bottom in Lawrence County. This damage was also confirmed by satellite imagery. The tornado destroyed the roof of a home and completely destroyed a metal building structure on Rayborn Lane. The homeowner also stated that a well built log cabin that he owned along the Pearl River was completely destroyed. After crossing the Pearl River, the tornado proceeded to impact areas just east of the river, causing more significant tree damage along River Road and Coon Hunting Road. The tornado completely destroyed several chicken houses and significantly damaged two homes near MS Highway 43 before crossing into Jefferson Davis County. Once in Jefferson Davis County, the tornado snapped and uprooted numerous trees along Johnson Road, Palestine Road, and Lily Rose Road. The tornado crossed MS Highway 13 snapping a couple of wooden power poles and causing damage to large sections of the roof of a one- story home.

A mobile home was destroyed along Newman Camp Road.|| ||The intensity of the tornado briefly increased to low end EF3 damage as it moved across Kirkley Lane, where extensive tree damage was noted. Damage to roofs, and the snapping and uprooting of trees continued as the tornado moved northeast. Large sections of a roof were removed from a one-story home on Haynes Gray Road, most walls of an apparently abandoned home were collapsed on SJ Garner Road, and the roof of a well built home was removed along Ross McPhail Road. Along Berry Loop, a mobile home was demolished and several other homes were heavily damaged.|| ||As the tornado neared MS Highway 35 and the Terrell community, it grew wider and stronger. Extensive tree damage and varying degrees of damage occurred to dozens of structures. In this area, multiple mobile homes were completely destroyed on both sides of the highway. A large church made of cinderblocks was leveled here and supportive of EF3 wind speeds near 150 mph. Multiple power lines were downed as well. The tornado reached its widest point in this location at 1.16 miles. EF3 tree damage continued as it crossed East Granby Road near the river as well as a small section when it crossed Three Notch Road. Several mobile homes were destroyed here as well. The tornado weakened a bit after this point, but remained strong as it crossed US 84 and neared US 49. A wide swath of extensive tree damage and downed power lines occurred along the path. A set of chicken houses west of Campbell Faler Road was destroyed, and a mobile home was rolled. As the tornado crossed Old Macintosh and Sunset Roads, more trees were downed along with some damage to structures. After crossing US 49, this strong tornado continued northeast where numerous trees were snapped and uprooted and a mobile home was destroyed on Hambone Road.|| ||The tornado continued across northeastern Covington County, crossing MS Highway 532 west of Hot Coffee, causing widespread tree damage and minor roof damage to some residential areas before crossing out of the county. The tornado then moved into northwest Jones and southern Smith County and crossed through the community of Summerland. Widespread tree damage continued through here, with some minor roof damage to residences, which was consistent with high end EF1 damage. A church along Smith County Road 8A had a steeple removed by the winds. The tornado then moved into southwestern Jasper County into the Stringer community. High end EF1 damage occurred in the area, with numerous trees snapped and uprooted in addition to a snapped power pole east of the community. Even though the circulation began to weaken, the tornado continued northeast and produced high end EF1 damage throughout central Jasper County before moving across the western side of Paulding. The tornado weakened in this area, still producing widespread EF0-EF1 tree damage as it crossed MS Highway 503 north of Paulding. The tornado lifted shortly thereafter along County Road 31.

Locations impacted by this tornado include Bassfield, the areas between Collins and Seminary, Soso, Moss, Heidelberg, and Pachuta. This tornado is preliminarily rated EF4 with an estimated peak wind of 190 MPH east of Bassfield in southwestern Jefferson Davis County. Additional EF4 damage was noted near Soso in Jones County and at Moss in Jasper County. The maximum path width was 2.25 miles in the vicinity of Hughes Road west of Seminary in western Covington County. At this width, the tornado ranks 3rd widest in the official NOAA United States tornado database behind the El Reno, OK tornado of 2013 (2.6 mi) and the Hallam, NE tornado of 2004 (2.5 mi). This tornado now ranks as the widest on record in the state of Mississippi, surpassing the Yazoo City, MS tornado of 2010 (1.75 mi). Eight lives were lost in this tornado, and there was an undetermined number of additional injuries. Additional details on the damage path and area of most significant damage follow.|| ||The tornado began south of Bassfield along Bassfield Cemetery Road, uprooting trees and resulting in relatively minor structural damage. As it proceeded northeastward, the diameter of the wind field steadily increased and the percentage of snapped trees in the center of the vortex increased considerably as the tornado approached MS Highway 42. At this location, two homes sustained major roof damage. Tornado intensity then began to increase quickly, with EF3 damage as it crossed Hosey Mikell Road, completely demolishing a mobile home and scattering the debris field over 300 yards downwind. Tree damage also ramped up significantly beyond this location, with low end EF4 damage in a narrow swath of nearly complete tree destruction along the center of the tornado vortex and increasing instances of debarking of trees as the tornado moved across Pitts Lane and Reese Road. Outside of this most intense corridor of tornadic winds, EF1 and EF2 damage to trees and structures was occurring over a wider area, up one mile wide. In addition, both ground surveys and aerial photography indicated the presence of multiple vortices at times. Intense damage continued as the tornado crossed the intersection of Graves Key Road and Harper Road, where a cinder block small business building was destroyed, with much of the slab swept clean. Four fatalities occurred at this location. Nearby, a mobile home was completely destroyed, with the undercarriage wrapped around the small set of trees that remained standing downwind. Debarking of some trees was again noted and continued along the tornado path across Claude Booth Road.|| ||The tornado reached its peak intensity as it moved across a field north of Graves Key Road. At this location, the foundation of a wood frame and metal roof cabin was swept clean. A truck parked at this cabin was tossed approximately 300 yards downwind, and trees that remained standing at this site were partially debarked. Though the path of the intense tornado vortex through the field surrounding this cabin was clearly visible, significant scouring was not noted. The tornado continued to remain violent and grow in size, nearly 1.5 miles wide, as it crossed Good Hope Road and continued to track toward the Bouie River. Here, a large swath of extreme tree damage was noted as the whole forest was leveled. An intense core of the tornado was evident by debarking of trees along a well defined center line or sub-vortex feature. Extreme debarking was noted around Willie Fortenberry Road. In this general area, several farmers reported roughly 60 cattle were killed by the tornado. The tornado grew larger as it entered Covington County and peaked in width in the vicinity of Hughes Road. Maximum width was measured at 2.25 miles. The incredible expansive tree damage continued along the path with millions of trees damaged. Several dozen structures were damaged or destroyed between McGowen Circle to US 49. Numerous chicken houses (23-30) were destroyed here as well. A section of Cold Springs Road looked to see another sub- vortex and it was here another area of EF4 damage occurred to a home.|| ||As the tornado crossed US 49, the width decreased to 1.7 miles, but it remained quite strong with mid to upper end EF3 damage noted. Extreme tree damage persisted in large swaths along the path. In addition, a few dozen structures were damaged between US 49 and MS Highway 588. This consisted of varying degrees of damage from EF1 to EF3 levels. The tornado entered northwestern Jones County near the Centerville community where several homes had shingles blown off or parts of the decking exposed. A mobile home along Tommy Pickering Road was thrown and separated from the frame, with the highest winds in the EF2 range. As the storm moved northeast across US 84, trees were uprooted and snapped. Several homes on both sides of the highway had decking exposed or shingles blown off. At least one mobile home was destroyed along US 84.

The tornado continued to remain violent and grow in size, nearly 1.5 miles wide, as it crossed Good Hope Road and continued to track toward the Bouie River. Here, a large swath of extreme tree damage was noted as the whole forest was leveled. An intense core of the tornado was evident by debarking of trees along a well defined center line or sub-vortex feature. Extreme debarking was noted around Willie Fortenberry Road. In this general area, several farmers reported roughly 60 cattle were killed by the tornado. The tornado grew larger as it entered Covington County and peaked in width in the vicinity of Hughes Road. Maximum width was measured at 2.25 miles. The incredible expansive tree damage continued along the path with millions of trees damaged. Several dozen structures were damaged or destroyed between McGowen Circle to US 49. Numerous chicken houses (23-30) were destroyed here as well. A section of Cold Springs Road looked to see another sub- vortex and it was here another area of EF4 damage occurred to a home.|| ||As the tornado crossed US 49, the width decreased to 1.7 miles, but it remained quite strong with mid to upper end EF3 damage noted. Extreme tree damage persisted in large swaths along the path. In addition, a few dozen structures were damaged between US 49 and MS Highway 588. This consisted of varying degrees of damage from EF1 to EF3 levels. The tornado entered northwestern Jones County near the Centerville community where several homes had shingles blown off or parts of the decking exposed. A mobile home along Tommy Pickering Road was thrown and separated from the frame, with the highest winds in the EF2 range. As the storm moved northeast across US 84, trees were uprooted and snapped. Several homes on both sides of the highway had decking exposed or shingles blown off. At least one mobile home was destroyed along US 84. The tornado intensified to an EF3 causing significant damage to multiple homes along Danny Hillburn Road, where large sections of roofing was removed. Between US 84 and MS Highway 29, several mobile homes were completely destroyed and at least one separated from the frame. Several homes had one or more exterior walls collapsed or large sections of the roof removed. The tornado continued to cause widespread destruction as it moved into the town of Soso. Several homes and churches received significant damage. Large swaths of trees were snapped and uprooted along MS Highway 29. Near the center of town, a fire station was heavily damaged when the overhead doors collapsed and portions of the roof were removed. Numerous homes had roofing removed and exposed decking. The worst damage occurred along MS Highway 28 where a convenience store was destroyed and several other cinder block structures were heavily damaged when the storm intensified to low end EF-4. The tornado continued to mow down large swaths of trees and caused major uplift and loss of roofing to numerous homes as it moved northeast toward MS Highway 15. Along Mathews Road numerous mobile homes and several outbuildings were completely destroyed.||The tornado intensified to a low end EF4 as it moved into the Moss community, where winds near 175 mph resulted in widespread devastation. Nearly every structure in the community was damaged with the most significant damage occurring along or near MS Highway 537. About half of the First Baptist Church of Moss was completely leveled. Numerous homes were destroyed or had major roofing loss or uplifted. A small pick-up truck was thrown several hundred yards and completely destroyed. In addition, multiple mobile homes were completely demolished.||As the storm tracked toward I-59 a few miles west of Heidelberg, hundreds of trees were mowed down, outbuildings were destroyed. Several homes and mobile homes had metal roofing peeled back or decking exposed. Large swaths of trees were snapped for several miles including some along I-59 between the Heidelberg and Vossburg exits. Swaths of tree damage continued into the Barnett community. In the town of Pachuta there was scattered tree damage and the metal roofing was peeled off of a church. About two miles north of Pachuta, the damage became sporadic and the tornado lifted in a wooded area along County Road 130.||The total path length was 67.43 miles. The maximum estimated wind speed of the tornado was 190mph, while the maximum wind speed in Jasper County was 178mph.","An outbreak of severe weather occurred on Easter Sunday, 2020. This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave.",477

This tornado is preliminarily rated EF3 with an estimated peak wind of 150 MPH near MS Highway 35 northeast of Carson in Jefferson Davis County. The maximum path width was 1.16 miles also near MS Highway 35 in Jefferson Davis County. No fatalities were reported in this tornado, but there was an undetermined number of injuries. Additional details on the damage path and area of most significant damage follow.|| ||The tornado initially touched down in southeastern Lawrence County 11 miles south of the city of Monticello, causing minor tree damage. The tornado quickly strengthened as it took a northeast track, producing EF1 and EF2 tree damage along Givens Road and Divide Road. From an elevated location on Divide Road, surveyors were able to view extensive tree damage and ground scouring in the inaccessible Pearl River bottom in Lawrence County. This damage was also confirmed by satellite imagery. The tornado destroyed the roof of a home and completely destroyed a metal building structure on Rayborn Lane. The homeowner also stated that a well built log cabin that he owned along the Pearl River was completely destroyed. After crossing the Pearl River, the tornado proceeded to impact areas just east of the river, causing more significant tree damage along River Road and Coon Hunting Road. The tornado completely destroyed several chicken houses and significantly damaged two homes near MS Highway 43 before crossing into Jefferson Davis County. Once in Jefferson Davis County, the tornado snapped and uprooted numerous trees along Johnson Road, Palestine Road, and Lily Rose Road. The tornado crossed MS Highway 13 snapping a couple of wooden power poles and causing damage to large sections of the roof of a one- story home. Two mobile homes were destroyed along Greens Creek Road, with additional roof damage to homes as well as snapping and uprooting trees as the tornado progressed northeastward. A mobile home was destroyed along Newman Camp Road.|| ||The intensity of the tornado briefly increased to low end EF3 damage as it moved across Kirkley Lane, where extensive tree damage was noted. Damage to roofs, and the snapping and uprooting of trees continued as the tornado moved northeast. Large sections of a roof were removed from a one-story home on Haynes Gray Road, most walls of an apparently abandoned home were collapsed on SJ Garner Road, and the roof of a well built home was removed along Ross McPhail Road. Along Berry Loop, a mobile home was demolished and several other homes were heavily damaged.|| ||As the tornado neared MS Highway 35 and the Terrell community, it grew wider and stronger. Extensive tree damage and varying degrees of damage occurred to dozens of structures. In this area, multiple mobile homes were completely destroyed on both sides of the highway. A large church made of cinderblocks was leveled here and supportive of EF3 wind speeds near 150 mph. Multiple power lines were downed as well. The tornado reached its widest point in this location at 1.16 miles. EF3 tree damage continued as it crossed East Granby Road near the river as well as a small section when it crossed Three Notch Road. Several mobile homes were destroyed here as well. The tornado weakened a bit after this point, but remained strong as it crossed US 84 and neared US 49. A wide swath of extensive tree damage and downed power lines occurred along the path. A set of chicken houses west of Campbell Faler Road was destroyed, and a mobile home was rolled. As the tornado crossed Old Macintosh and Sunset Roads, more trees were downed along with some damage to structures. After crossing US 49, this strong tornado continued northeast where numerous trees were snapped and uprooted and a mobile home was destroyed on Hambone Road.|| ||The tornado continued across northeastern Covington County, crossing MS Highway 532 west of Hot Coffee, causing widespread tree damage and minor roof damage to some residential areas before crossing out of the county. The tornado then moved into northwest Jones and southern Smith County and crossed through the community of Summerland. Widespread tree damage continued through here, with some minor roof damage to residences, which was consistent with high end EF1 damage. A church along Smith County Road 8A had a steeple removed by the winds. The tornado then moved into southwestern Jasper County into the Stringer community. High end EF1 damage occurred in the area, with numerous trees snapped and uprooted in addition to a snapped power pole east of the community. Even though the circulation began to weaken, the tornado continued northeast and produced high end EF1 damage throughout central Jasper County before moving across the western side of Paulding. The tornado weakened in this area, still producing widespread EF0-EF1 tree damage as it crossed MS Highway 503 north of Paulding. The tornado lifted shortly thereafter along County Road 31. The maximum wind speed was 150mph in Jefferson Davis County, but was 140mph in Covington County.

It quickly moved across the Harris Hills area where some trees were uprooted and then continued towards East Brainerd Road and Stratman Circle where an auto parts store was completely leveled and nearby structures had significant roof damage done. The tornado then struck the end of a large shopping building where a restaurant was located. The restaurant facade was destroyed and the roof was peeled back. This is where the tornado picked up strength and was near its peak intensity. It continued northeast into the Drake Forest neighborhood where extensive structure, roof, and tree damage was noted. There were likely pockets of EF-3 damage here, as well. The tornado damage path really widened as it moved northeast into the Holly Hills neighborhood. This was likely the widest part of the tornado. Nearly as far as you could see to the southeast, tree trunks were snapped and significant home damage was noted. Some areas were blocked by tree debris and fallen power poles as well as large debris removal machinery which limited easy access to some areas. Additional damage was found in Ooltewah near the Summit Softball Complex and particularly significant roof damage to several units/buildings of the Integra Hills Preserve Apartments.

Beyond this point, the unusually long track and wide tornado damaged and destroyed many residences, including mobile and single family homes along its entire path. A few automobiles were also tossed/rolled 50 to 75 yards from their original locations. In addition, the tornado reached a maximum width of about 0.75 mile, causing extensive damage to thousands of trees and numerous power lines. At times, the damage pattern suggested that the tornado may have consisted of multiple vortices, which can occur in stronger tornadoes.||The most significant structural damage occurred just south of Estill, South Carolina and across Nixville, South Carolina, where at least six residences were destroyed.

The tornado then continued northeast where it completely destroyed a mobile home near the intersection of Highway 3 and Highway 601, tragically claiming the lives of 2 adult males. Continuing on a northeast track, the tornado heavily damaged homes near the intersection of Turner Expressway and Brandy Lane, including completely destroying a mobile home that tragically claimed the lives of 2 adult females and 1 adult male. The tornado then reached peak EF-4 intensity along Lento Road where the roof and all exterior/interior walls of a two story home were removed and dispersed across the yard.

It crossed into Marion County near the intersection of MS Highway 48 and Mt Bethel Road. The tornado then began to move more northeastward as it moved into southwestern Marion County, uprooting and snapping several softwood trees, causing minor roof damage to a home, and destroying an outdoor small shed along New Hope Road. It also snapped several trees and peeled the tin roof of a barn along A Pittman, Marks and Davis Roads. The tornado intensified relatively quickly once it moved northeast, snapping the majority of trees close to the ground in a wooded area east of New Hope Road. The basis for the low-end EF4 rating was a home on Johnson Road that was completely destroyed with its debris pushed to a corner of the foundation leaving residual vinyl flooring and a few of its anchor bolts bent. Furthermore, across the street from the aforementioned home, in a field a few of the snapped trees sustained patchy debarking. A higher rating was not assigned because the contents of the home were not spread a significant distance from the foundation and debris remained over a part of the slab. Nonetheless, significant damage to the home and nearby trees occurred. In addition, multiple wooden power poles were snapped, several other homes had significant roof damage and multiple mobile homes were completely destroyed, resulting in one fatality. Continual uprooting and snapping of trees was observed at Hurricane Creek Road, in addition to minor roof damage to a shed and a one-story home. When the tornado crossed Hurricane Creek Church Road, it caused significant roof damage to the Hurricane Creek Baptist Church and the nearby pastor's home. Behind the pastor's home was a large 40-foot shed that sat partially on cinder blocks and partially on a slab that was bolted down. This shed was completely destroyed as it was blown a few feet away. Several headstones in a cemetery were knocked over at this location as well. Additional roof damage to multiple homes and the uprooting and snapping of numerous trees along Hurricane Creek Road to the intersection of MS Highway 35. When the tornado reached MS Highway 35, it snapped multiple wooden power-poles and continued snapping trees. It continued east- northeast to Old MS Highway 35 causing numerous snapping of hardwood trees and the removal of a portion of a one-story home roof. The tornado continued moving east-northeast across the Pearl River bottom, when it reached MS Highway 43, multiple wooden power-poles were snapped, some minor roof damage occurred to some one-story homes and hardwood trees were snapped. Just east of MS Highway 43 along Joe Magee Road, a brick home sustained significant damage as the roof was completely destroyed and a few exterior walls were collapsed. A swath of snapped softwood trees was noted along Abrams Road thus producing EF2 damage.||Once the tornado reached MS Highway 13 and surrounding streets such as Pine Burr Road and Firetower Road near the Marion and Lamar county borders, a slight decline in strength was noted, though its path remained wide. Although, it was still snapping large tree limbs and snapping and uprooting some softwood trees, several of which fell onto wooden power poles and caused them to fall. The tornado maintained its east northeastward track, knocking thousands of trees down along with numerous power lines and poles down across the western portions of Lamar County. This tree damage was consistent with high end EF1 winds peaking between 100-110 mph. Around a dozen homes were damaged starting from Luther Saucier Rd to Purvis to Columbia Road, including one old mobile home that was completely destroyed. As the tornado continued to track east northeastward to the north of Purvis. It crossed Purvis Oloh Road, MS Highway 589 along with US 11. Hundreds of trees were damaged along with many power lines down. Some minor damage occurred to some homes. The tornado was slightly weaker here with winds between 90- 100mph. The tornado crossed I-59 into Forrest County along Ford and Elks Lodge Road in the Dixie community. Hundreds of trees were damaged along with many power lines down. Sheds and several homes had minor damage and one mobile home had the roof blown off. The tornado then crossed US 49 a couple miles north of Southgate Road. The tornado proceeded into Camp Shelby. At Camp Shelby, there were widespread snapped and uprooted trees. Multiple structures across the north half, in and around Lee Avenue to Glenn Walker Lake, had varying degrees of minor to moderate roof damage from the tornado or fallen trees. The park and camper area on the north end of the lake was impacted. One person was injured here as a large tree fell on a truck. The tornado then crossed over US 98 just west of the Perry County line. It continued into Perry County along the Leaf River bottom, snapping and uprooting trees. It continued to track just south of Old River Road before dissipating along Old River Road three miles northwest of New Augusta. Total path length was 53.76 miles.","A very unstable airmass was in place across the region as a frontal boundary was stalled across the central portions of the ArkLaMiss region.

The tornado killed three and injured 33 in Onalaska with 291 homes affected and 46 destroyed. It was estimated to be about 500 yards wide as it moved across the town. The tornado continued a general east-|northeastward track across rural Polk county where it snapped and uprooted numerous hardwood and softwood trees and intermittently damaged structures. The tornado path was measured at just over a half-mile wide as it crossed Highway 59 near Seven Oaks, where EF2 damage was surveyed with destruction of two mobile homes and |damage to hardwood trees. The tornado remained in rural areas until it ended very close to Barnes in northeast Polk county. Near the end of the track, a large tree destroyed a mobile home and miraculously just missed a man who was sitting at his computer. He was not seriously injured.
