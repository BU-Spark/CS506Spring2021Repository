### Scrum #1 - 3/23/2021

## Team Name and Contributors

Team: Natual Disaster Prediction  

Contributors:  
- Simon Angel,
- Abdullaah Robins, 
- Frazier Horn, 
- Alvaro Carrascosa  

## Summary

- Met with Yifu
- Summarized the project description & goal.
  - Analyze top ~100 major tornados of the past decade and weather data leading up to it.
- Previewed the analysis we had so far
  - The graphs of weather, radiation, windspeed leading up to tornado

## Feedback
- Looks like a binary classification scenario
- Does the season affect it the weather? 
- Look at location or frequencies.
- We can find more unsupervised methods to observe this?
- You can generate more data from this data and correlate it; we have only done one to one correlations
