# CS506_Final_Project
# Police Budget & OT Data (Spring 2021)  
Final project for CS506.

## About
### 1. Project Description
The clients would like to build on the previous semester’s work regarding police court overtime and budget analysis and focus on special events pay abuse. 
This project starts with the upcoming FY22 police union contract up for renegotiation in March, the clients would like to use the results obtained from 
this project to make informed decisions on: (1) identifying instances of financial excess in BPD spending, (2) characterizing wasteful BPD overtime practices,
and (3) using data to fill in narratives around waste & misconduct by individual BPD officers.

See [Police Budget & OT Data (Spring 2021)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Af--sWikquT86yYEt350XWe9OlwcGvX1MFFg_c_C93w/edit) for complete information.

### 4. Limitations
1. There are no obvious discrepancies between the WRKDHRS, the real hours worked by officers at a special event, and the OTHOURS, the number of hours logged by officers at special events. This discrepancies existed in the Court Overtime data from last semester. Hence, for our analysis we will have to look more specifically at the trends for events, officers, pay, from the Special Events Overtime data to uncover abuse of the overtime system.


## Deliverables

See Syllabus for due dates. Project deliverables can be modified with approval of PMs, the client, or the instructor.

### Project Deliverable 0

Teams should have set up weekly meetings with their client for the remainder of the semester,  reviewed the project scope, and submitted a pull request with the revised and final project description. Project descriptions should include data sources that your team will collect, including any additional datasets you identify that you think would enhance the project, specific questions that will be answered and the step by step approach you will take for transforming the data (cleaning) and answering strategic questions.

#### Checklist

- [ ] Reviewed all previous material
- [ ] Revised scope of the project if needed
- [ ] Identify / list limitations with data and potential risks of achieving project goal
- [ ] Meet with client to review the project
- [ ] Schedule weekly meetings with PMs and bi-weekly with client
- [ ] Submit a PR with the revised project proposal including list of limitations

### Project Deliverable 1

Sufficient data should have been collected to perform a preliminary analysis of the data and attempt to answer one question relevant to your project proposal which you will submit as a pull request. If data has already been collected for your project you must answer two questions.

#### Checklist

- [ ] Collect and pre-process a preliminary batch of data
- [ ] Perform a preliminary analysis of the data
- [ ] Answer one key question
- [ ] Refine project scope and list of limitations with data and potential risks of achieving project goal
- [ ] Submit a PR with the above report and modifications to original proposal

### Project Deliverable 2

More data should have been collected to perform a more thorough analysis of the data and attempt to answer one additional question relevant to your project proposal which you will submit as a pull request.

#### Checklist

- [ ] Collect and pre-process a secondary batch of data
- [ ] Refine the preliminary analysis of the data performed in PD1
- [ ] Answer another key question
- [ ] Refine project scope and list of limitations with data and potential risks of achieving project goal

### Project Deliverable 3 (v1 Final Report)

All data should have been collected. All project questions should have been reviewed, answered, and submitted in a written document outlining findings as a PR.
