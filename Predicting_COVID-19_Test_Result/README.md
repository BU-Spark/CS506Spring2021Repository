# Project Description
We seek to predict COVID-19 test result from symptoms and comorbidities. We gather covid-19 test data along with their symptoms from the internet and choose which to use. We believe there is a relationship between specific symptom(s) and the possibility of the test result. We will try to unveil the symptoms that contribute most to the test result and build model to predict the result based on selected symptoms.
