# Baystate Banner Research: LatinX Populations x Trump Voters
 
## Organization: Baystate Banner

### Organization Description:

The Bay State Banner is an African American-owned newsweekly that reports on the political, economic, social, and cultural issues that are of interest to African American and English speaking Latinos in Boston and throughout New England. 

## Project Scope:

The goal of the project is to find whether or not there is a significant difference in the voting pattern of the LatinX community in Massachusetts’s presidential and governor elections from 2016 to 2020. We will be collecting each city’s demographic and historical voting data from cities with a majority LatinX population (Lawrence, Springfield, Lynn) and non-LatinX populations (Acushnet, Southwick, Douglas) and comparing them to see whether there is a significant difference in voting patterns between the LatinX community and the control group (which has voted Republican consistently in the past). 

## Data Sets:

Voter data includes total ballots cast, registered voters, eligible voters, and demographics for that ward precinct. Election races will include 2016 and 2020 Presidential races as well as 2014 and 2018 MA Governor-general elections.

## Methods:

#### Data pre-processing: 
We will be using Pandas to process the .csv files into data frames for data extraction. Numpy will be used to organize the data frames into data structures used for further analysis

#### Data visualization:
Dependent on the client’s request after seeing processed data, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Tableau may be used to visualize and convey the project’s findings.

## Limitations & Risks:

1. Not having enough data to conduct a significant or effective geospatial analysis.

2. Not being able to distinguish between each type of Latinx voter within the general population. 

3. Difficulty of finding raw data that includes both a city’s demographic breakdown and voting history

4. Due to the long span of time between each issuance of census data, a significant risk would be using past data to create assumptions on the modern-day population which may not be accurate

## Questions to be answered:

1. How has support for Trump shifted across LatinX sub-groups from 2016 to 2020?

2. What is the breakdown of LatinX sub-groups in their support for Democratic vs. Republican candidates? Which communities did not show significant change?

3. Did changes in the LatinX community voting patterns from 2016 to 2020 show a significant impact on the overall result of Massachusetts’ election results in 2020?

4. If there is a significant change, what factors(i.e. Environment: economic, political, social, etc.) contributed to it and why did it occur?
